Welcome to GEO Chatbot's documentation!

=========================

**GEO chatbot** is an AI-powered application providing the users with a friendly and context-aware experience when answering their queries.
The four AI models, **OpenAIChatGenerator**, **Deepseek**, and **Llama**, and **OpenAI**, are used in this study. 
The user can choose their preferred model type for comparing their performance. 
They are implemented through RAG to provide precise document retrieval as context for understanding and interpreting each question asked.
