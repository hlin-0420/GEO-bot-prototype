There are different kinds of LIS, which are supported by the LIS-LAS Converter routine No No Canadian Well Log ASCII (CWLAS) LASData_load This is a special ASCII implementation of wireline data that allows for specific categories of information to coexist with data. GEO can load LAS data directly. Yes Yes Text (ASCII) ASC, TXTData_load Mudlog, MWD and well test data are usually in the Text File format. Sometimes, the data is presented in columns which are delimited by SPACES. Such Text files MUST be prepared (externally or within GEO before they can be loaded to the ODF database. Yes Yes Comma Separated Values (ASCII) CSVData_load Some service companies present mudlog data as comma separated values. Spreadsheets such as Excel and Lotus 123 can also create output in comma separated values format. This data can be directly read by GEO. Yes Yes Tab Delimited (ASCII) TXTData_load One form of ASCII formats. Tab delimited files are also created when data is saved as a \u2018Text file\u2019 in spreadsheet applications. This kind of data can be directly read by GEO. Yes Yes Metafile CGMExport_CGM The ISO-8632 implementation of Computer Graphics Metafile. This popular format can be used to plot to plotters such as Versatec or HP Design Jets. It is limited by the size of the plot. No Yes Windows Metafile WMFExport_WMF Both placeable and standard Windows Metafiles are supported. This is an easy way of getting graphical information to (and from) other applications such as Word and Excel. No Yes Enhanced Metafile EMFExport_EMF Enhanced Metafiles are supported. This is another way of getting graphical information to (and from) other applications such as Word and Excel. Yes Yes Scalable Vector Graphics SVGExport_SVG SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML (XML-10). SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves), images and text. Yes Extensible Mark-up Language XMLExport_XML The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is the universal format for structured documents and data on the Web. Geologix, as a full member of the Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation [POSC] has been instrumental in defining the WellPlotML and WellLogML definitions. No No VIEW VEW The View file contains the layout-related settings needed to create a log. These settings are normally entered by the user and may be stored for ease of recall when the same layout is required for subsequent well logs i.e. the standard composite log presentation. Yes Yes Output Database File ODF The Output Database File is a database where the wireline, mudlog or any other imported data, together with the layout-related View information and the Interpretation-related data is stored. The ODF enables the rapid recall of all data relating to a particular well, either for further editing/update or for the production of further logs. No No ODF Database Template ODT File that is created from an ODF with all required components, such as headers, tables, & lithology and then saved as a template in GEO. No No ODF Interval File OIF These files are concerned with only a specific user defined depth interval from an ODF file. Yes Yes ODF Update File OUFFiles_OUFConcept Small and sequential update files, which only contain updated information since the last file save. Ordinarily sent as daily updates from the well site to the operation offices.

These files may be opened by applications of the GEO Software Suite, to allow full data sharing with users of the GEODraft application.
