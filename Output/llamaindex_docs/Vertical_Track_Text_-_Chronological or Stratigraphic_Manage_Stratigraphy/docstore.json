This will determine the hierarcy in the Stratigraphy manager.\n\nOn the Edit tab, select Track Settings. The Track Settings will open.\n\nSelect the text track you wish to make a 'child' of another track i.e. select the Series track.\n\nIn the Main tab, open the Select a Parent Text Track list, and select the parent track i.e. the parent track of Series, would be System. Note. Only tracks defined as Chronological/Stratigraphic will be listed here.\n\nClick Apply and Close\n\nThe track entries are arranged in a tree structure that allows you to browse track placement, stratigraphical parent and depth range.\n\nYou can also edit the text entry 'name' and depth range, and export the data to clipboard.\n\nOpen Stratigraphy Manager\n\nOn the Tools tab, select Stratigraphy.\n\nChange the Name\n\nSelect the name of the entry you wish to change. Edit the name in the Text box and click Update.\n\nChange Depth Range\n\nThe depth range of each entry within a given chronostratigrapical track is displayed in brackets at the end of the entry name.\n\nAny depth changes made here will be reflected in the plot.\n\nSelect the entry you wish to change. Edit the depth range in From and To then Update.\n\nChange Track Column Widths\n\nYou may increase or decrease the amount of displacement between each branch of the tree, allowing you to customize how much info that is visible.\n\nTo do this, locate the horizontally segmented bar that details the chronostratigraphic track headers within the ODF. Where any two of the track columns meet, click with the left mouse button. You can then drag the cursor right or left, depending on whether you wish to expand or reduce the chronostratigraphic tree. The other tracks will resize in proportion.\n\nExport to Clipboard\n\nTo export all the information from the Stratigraphy manager click Export to Clipboard. The information from the lower pane will be exported in the proportions set by the collapsible column header bar.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2464, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"2196a21c-5146-48d2-ba43-c84cebaea46e": {"doc_hash": "335444e4cba0385398486e979029d31f434309d16a11f43e02ae289e3c829e7c", "ref_doc_id": "d4f2f57a-3070-44dc-b70f-96b8773808bf"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"d4f2f57a-3070-44dc-b70f-96b8773808bf": {"node_ids": ["2196a21c-5146-48d2-ba43-c84cebaea46e"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Vertical_Track_Text_-_Chronological or Stratigraphic\\Manage_Stratigraphy.htm"}}}}
