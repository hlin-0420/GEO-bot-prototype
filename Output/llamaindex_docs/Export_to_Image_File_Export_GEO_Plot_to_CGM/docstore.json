This limitation does not of course arise when plotting under the UNIX platform.\n\nGEO can export to CGM files with either 16 or 32-bit precision.\n\nThe 16-bit CGM complies with ISO-8362 binary specifications and may not be able to cope with very long plots.\n\nThe 32-bit CGM, on the other hand, is equipped to handle any length of plot and is compatible with PIP (Petroleum Information Profile).\n\nExport Plot to CGM\n\nOn the Edit tab, select Headers and Trailers. The Plot Header and Trailer Specifications dialog box will open. Tip. If a trailer component such as a spreadsheet was loaded with the OLE object check box selected, you can remove the OLE object with the following simple procedure.\n\nDouble-click that spreadsheet in the trailer in GEO to open it in the native application (perhaps MS Excel).\n\nCopy it to the clipboard and load it back at the Plot Header and Trailer Specifications dialog box, with the same name, but this time ensure the OLE object check box is clear (no tick).\n\nOn the GEO menu, select Print and select a printer that will allow you to set the paper size at a certain value, so the paper\u2019s width is greater than the plot width. Save these settings but do not print. Note. The exported plot will be cut off on width, if the paper size set at this Print Setup is less than the original plot\u2019s width. Tip. Our experience dictates that the Epson Stylus Color 1520 printer driver is a good driver for creating reliable CGM exports. Note that although this driver may be the optimum to use for CGM production, it is not necessary to physically have such a printer available or attached to your computer; only the driver need be installed (from https://www.epson.co.uk/support?productID=3838&os=22#drivers_and_manuals) and the printer selected within GEO.\n\nOn the Edit tab, select Edit GEO Settings. The Registry Editor dialog box will open.\n\nOpen the CGM tab and ensure that the fonts are correctly mapped between Windows and CGM Interpreter (such as ZEH Graphics or SDI software); for this you may need assistance from the personnel within your IT Department or Help Desk. Select Apply.\n\nOpen the CGM Advanced tab and check the settings. Note. The defaults are usually good in most cases.\n\nOn the Export tab, select Export as... then CGM. The Export to CGM (32 bit) will open.\n\nEnter the File name and specify the path to save to.\n\nClick Save.\n\nFor output to the plotter, such as the HP DesignJet series transfer the corresponding CGM format and its parameter file (with par extension) to the plotter by using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to the UNIX platform.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3064, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"298e733e-9e7e-4c76-be8c-015d93a8b2b0": {"doc_hash": "f01812404d7a199e303c62f2adadd6bb109c49766630fe6a51e40369cb97afd2", "ref_doc_id": "3b2bea0f-30c1-404f-81fc-b086a60a7d14"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"3b2bea0f-30c1-404f-81fc-b086a60a7d14": {"node_ids": ["298e733e-9e7e-4c76-be8c-015d93a8b2b0"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Sharing\\Export_Data_and_Information\\Export_to_Image_File\\Export_GEO_Plot_to_CGM.htm"}}}}
