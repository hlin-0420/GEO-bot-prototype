This new style of renting gives greater flexibility for rental terms and also increased access to updates.\n\nThe clock on your machine now governs your rental periods. A license will run from one set date and time to another set date and time. The period between these two dates will be when you can access your GEO Software Suite application.\n\nShould you require more time on the current rental or foresee a period where you may require the GEO Software Suite again, a new license file can be sent via e-mail to update your dongles validity.\n\nLicense Update File\n\nThe update file that is used to update the validity of your CodeMeter RUS license requires a .WibuCmRaU file.\n\nThe update file is used to update the validity of your RUS dongle. The .WibuCmRaU file contains the information pertaining to the rental period. These files can be sent directly via e-mail and can instantly be applied to gain access to GEO Software Suite applications.\n\nUpdating a License/License Expiry\n\nThis can be done in two ways depending on the current status of the license in the RUS dongle.\n\nIf a rental period is still active. You may extend a rental period with an update (.WibuCmRaU file) before the current license expires by selecting Update license Validity from the Help menu, however you cannot apply a brand new license period (in the future) whilst a previous period is still active. Once the current license has expired a new one can be applied.\n\nAn extension can also be applied after the license has expired, this is detailed below.\n\nIf a rental period has expired. Attempting to run the application will invoke a dialog allowing you to browse to and apply a new license file (.WibuCmRaU). GEO will automatically run once the new license has been applied. If you do not have a license file and wish to request one, please follow the procedure below.\n\nRequesting a Rental Update\n\nIf you are presented with a dialog box when accessing GEO you license has either expired or close to expiring.\n\nChoose the appropriate option from the warning dialog. The Request License Renewal E-mail will invoke. You will see that some information is already pre-filled for you. All you have to do is supply the dates of your new rental period and fill in your personal/company (license) details.\n\nOn receipt of your request we shall provide a response e-mail notifying you that we are dealing with your request.\n\nYou will receive thereafter another e-mail stating a successful request and the new license (.WibuCmRaU) file, or adversely an unsuccessful reply e-mail, where upon you may try again or contact us using one of our other support mediums.\n\nOpening/Applying a License Update File\n\nYou can apply a license file from either the Help tab (then select Update license Validity) or the Expiry warning dialog box. In both cases the Select License File dialog box will appear.\n\nLocate your .WibuCmRaU file\n\nClick on it so it appears in the File Name section.\n\nClick OK to apply the new license information.\n\nNew license Period activated indication will appear.\n\nShould you need to change your computers clock\n\nImportant. Usage Information is stored in the RUS dongle using your computers clock. If changing your machine time is required i.e. you are changing time zones, it is recommended that you use the Time Zones feature accessible through the Windows clock, rather than changing your time manually. Changing the clock manually will disrupt the time configuration and you may risk losing time on your rental - or worse rendering your licence completely inaccessible.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3833, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"91116c05-c34b-4293-bd76-7546662c6254": {"doc_hash": "5331d07b95fc0984a4d4c4cf7976b8b4ebd714a570894c6222bc81adeb6773c1", "ref_doc_id": "82fa5b44-9940-43bd-9e62-586cc0b43991"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"82fa5b44-9940-43bd-9e62-586cc0b43991": {"node_ids": ["91116c05-c34b-4293-bd76-7546662c6254"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Introduction\\RUS_Rental_Dongle_Guide.htm"}}}}
