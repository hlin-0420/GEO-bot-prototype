In curve lists, the file ID will follow the curve name. User-defined Curves that are created by the user in Curve Data on the Curve tab by entering the depth and corresponding data values. Computed Curve that are generated within GEO, derived from loaded curves, constants, parameters, and expressions within the Computed Curves section on the Curves tab. Spliced Curves that are generated by the user, using the Splice feature on the Curves tab. They are created from a section of one or multiple curves. Table Curves that are generated from the table data. Edited Non-user defined curves that have been edited in Curve Data on the Curve tab.\n\nNote. Computed Curves are a standard feature only for GEO and GEOLite.\n\nOnly user-defined curves allow the editing of depth values and creation of new depth values.\n\nYou can edit only the data values for all other curve types.\n\nGEO always retains a copy of the original loaded or computed curve data, and you can choose to toggle display between edited and original curves. Once a non user-defined curve\u2019s data has been modified or edited, the curve is then marked as edited.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1574, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"6c739c8a-7c32-4207-9822-7c0d08964964": {"doc_hash": "20047686da69bac01dc2df52d5506e1aefadfa49eacf86828af109fa77620ebe", "ref_doc_id": "31a4599f-3964-4930-b86f-94d17e3aef13"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"31a4599f-3964-4930-b86f-94d17e3aef13": {"node_ids": ["6c739c8a-7c32-4207-9822-7c0d08964964"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Curve_Display\\Curve_Types_in_GEO.htm"}}}}
