It consists of integers which represent specific dip types\n\nThe Dip/Deviation is represented by the position of the tadpole body on the track where the track edges reflect the two extremes of dip; 0 and 90 degrees.\n\nThe Azimuth is depicted by the orientation of the tadpole \u2018tail\u2019.\n\nThe Quality is reflected by the \u2018fill\u2019 of the tadpole body. Four quality thresholds can be defined.\n\nThe Dip Type can be reflected either by the tadpole color or the 'Dip Name' which displays in the track legend.\n\nPresent tadpoles on the plot\n\nPlease ensure that appropriate tadpole curve data has been loaded into the ODF.\n\nEnsure that the curve data has been configured as 'Tadpole Data' - on the Curve tab, select Curve Settings, the Curve Settings sidebar will open. Select the tadpole data from the Curve list, then Close the list. Open the Data tab and expand the Display node. The Use Data for Tadpole Presentation should be ticked.\n\nOn the Workflows tab, select Tadpole Definitions. The Tadpole Definitions will open.\n\nFor a new tadpole definition, select an unused number from the Select a Definition.\n\nEnter a name for this tadpole definition in the Definition Name box.\n\nTick both the In Use and Display on Plot check boxes in order to display this tadpole definition on your log.\n\nSelect appropriate curves for the Dip/Deviation, Azimuth, Quality and Dip Type by clicking on the down arrow to the right of their corresponding boxes and choosing from the tadpole data available.\n\nIf referencing a Dip Type curve, please define each dip type by filling in the appropriate fields in the panel to the right of the Dip Type box. To add more rows to the panel, use the keyboard down arrow. If you wish to display tadpoles with undefined dip types, please ensure that you tick the Display Tadpoles on Plot with Undefined Dip Types check box.\n\nSelect the track that you wish to display the tadpoles on in the Track for plotting Tadpole Data box and the dip/deviation data scale at the Left edge and Right edge boxes.\n\nDefine the Quality threshold by entering an appropriate value for each fill type in the corresponding boxes.\n\nAdjust the tadpole Circle Diameter and its Tail length in the Tadpole Symbol Parameters section.\n\nClick Update.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2732, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"f60ba7df-eaa9-4195-a163-12728d0bcec8": {"doc_hash": "ae6b6ffbe9a0a82f76340eba692f8e97f3a529d8c09d499538e1eb9392a6bfb6", "ref_doc_id": "088339af-e376-4920-bf7f-8d169223087c"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"088339af-e376-4920-bf7f-8d169223087c": {"node_ids": ["f60ba7df-eaa9-4195-a163-12728d0bcec8"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Curve_Display\\Present_Curve_in_Tadpole_Format.htm"}}}}
