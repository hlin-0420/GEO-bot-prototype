The Open dialog box will open.\n\nIn Look In, browse to the data file location.\n\nEnsure the correct Files of Type is selected. Curve data can be imported as LAS or Text file.\n\nSelect the file and click Open. The Data Import Wizard: Step 1 of 2 will invoke.Data Import Wizard Step 1.\n\nData Import Wizard Step 1\n\nDefine the data file Type.\n\nDelimited text files that conform to the Ascii standard will automatically be recognized. The Delimited Text button and the delimitation character (tab, comma etc.) will be selected.\n\nOtherwise, Fixed Width Text will be selected together with the delimitation character (if any).\n\nFor LAS files, LAS will be selected.\n\nSelect a Data Source Type. This is required to continue to step 2 of the wizard. The data source type allows the curves to be grouped in the Curve Settings dialog box.\n\nSelect the Data Type.\n\nIn most circumstances Curve Data should be selected.\n\nTadpole Data should only be selected if the data you are loading is to be plotted in Tadpole format.\n\nImaging Data should only be selected if the data you are loading is to be used in the creation of an LWD or Wireline imaging log.\n\nProvide the data with a File ID. By default this field will display the name of the loaded text data. This can be useful in providing an audit trail, since the File ID will appear within the Curve Settings dialog box, showing which curves were loaded concurrently. There is also an option to refine the curve list displayed in curve settings based on the File ID.\n\nEnter, or select from the list, the name of the data Vendor (Schlumberger, Baker Hughes etc.). This is optional but helps to provide an audit trail for the data you load into the ODF.\n\nVisually check the data prior to loading, within the lower scrollable panel of this wizard screen.\n\nChoose the row of data which is recognized the and \u2018first row\u2019 using the Set the current Top Line as the First section.\n\nIf you want to load data beginning from a depth (or time) other than the first data row in the file, scroll vertically so that the data row you want to start from is the topmost visible, then click Data Line.\n\nIf your file contains non-required information ahead or the row that contains the curve mnemonics, scroll vertically so that the line containing the curve mnemonics is the topmost visible, then click Header Line.\n\nTo load data which has TVD as the index, select Index contains TD values. Note. This data will only display when the log is in TVD mode.\n\nClick Next to proceed to Step 2 of the wizard.\n\nData Import Wizard Step 2\n\nDefine the curve data range you wish to load in the Depth From and To. By default GEO will list the depth range in the curve data file.\n\nSpecify the Use as Null data value. This is also know as the pen-up value. By default GEO uses -999.25 but this can be changed as required by your dataset.\n\nChoose how to display the null data values using the Treat Null data values as \"empty\" check box.\n\nLeave unchecked to 'pen-up' when null data values are encountered. The curve will stop drawing when null values are encountered, resulting discontinuous curve.\n\nCheck to draw a continuous curve joining the last good value with the next.\n\nLoad Data into a Contiguous set of Curves\n\nBy defaults, this will be checked. The data will be loaded as a 'block' of curves with consecutive curve numbers.\n\nUncheck to load curves into any empty curve number rows before filling previously un allocated rows in sequence.\n\nAppend Overlapping Curves. Check to append overlapping curves, or uncheck to not append. The default status is determined by the Data Source Type selection made in step 1 of the wizard.\n\nFor Wireline or Other types the check box will be unselected.\n\nFor MWD/LWD, Mudlog and Mineralogy, the check box will be selected.\n\nAppend Non-overlapping Curves. Check to append non-overlapping curves or uncheck to not append.
