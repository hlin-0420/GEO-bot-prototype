The Specify Access for Document will open.\n\nFrom the Select Desired Access list, select the Update access level.\n\nIn the Enter Password for Access, type the chosen password.\n\nRe-confirm the password in the Re-enter Password box. Note. The password is not case sensitive and its maximum length is 15 characters.\n\nClick Update.\n\nRepeat this process for the View / Print and Export access level listed in the Select desired Access box.\n\nClick Update.\n\nNote. Remember to keep a record of your chosen password(s) in a secure place, as once password protected you will not be able to open the ODF, or change/remove password protection without the correct Update level password.\n\nNext time the ODF file is saved, the password protection will be implemented at the chosen access level.\n\nEach time the ODF file is opened thereafter, the appropriate password must be entered for the required access level.\n\nNotes. You cannot apply a password for View / Print access, without first applying a password for Update access.\n\nPassword protection can be removed/changed only by opening the ODF with the Update access level password, and then deleting the entries in the password fields. You must delete the View / Print access password first, before attempting to remove the password for Update access.\n\nTip. If a password for Update access has been applied to an ODF, you basically send it as a \u2018Read-Only\u2019 file to another party (or simply like a picture). The other party will not have any access to the data that builds this ODF, unless they are separately provided with the appropriate password.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2036, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"087bd09e-dcfc-4cd0-a980-852fa895ee7d": {"doc_hash": "c44a155cb0b4cd2fe74b3935d797e1db395fb0d096727d295078cc8705010d16", "ref_doc_id": "5c429e92-cd30-400a-b506-e64528b13aa3"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"5c429e92-cd30-400a-b506-e64528b13aa3": {"node_ids": ["087bd09e-dcfc-4cd0-a980-852fa895ee7d"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Sharing\\Protecting_your_ODF_File.htm"}}}}
