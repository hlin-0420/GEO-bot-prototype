This is very useful for editing your logs on the go, whilst away from your main laptop or PC.\n\nThe available gestures are listed below.\n\nPan\n\n\n\nUse panning to see another part of a page that has scroll bars. For example, you can pan to see part of a long document or spreadsheet that doesn't appear in the window.\n\nSimply touch and drag the page with two fingers.\n\nMoving objects\n\n\n\nPress and hold on the object you would like to move, drag it to it's new location and then lift your finger.\n\nPress and hold\n\n\n\nPress and hold does the same thing as right-clicking an item.\n\nTo perform the action, touch the screen where you want to right-click, hold until a complete circle appears, and then lift your finger. The shortcut menu appears after you lift your finger.\n\nZoom\n\n\n\nUse zooming to make an item on the screen larger or smaller. Zooming in shows a smaller area in more detail; zooming out shows a larger area.\n\nTo zoom out, touch two points on the item, and then move your fingers toward each other, as if you're pinching them together. To zoom in, touch two points on the item, and then move your fingers away from each other, as if you're stretching them apart.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1458, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"97aa385b-691c-49eb-862b-eb6b1e08dfaa": {"doc_hash": "8863a63c28bbda5771508a55e50580e1d168e0c8060d337eb7968b51466cae37", "ref_doc_id": "124b15ec-a492-4ee5-a6ad-2c695cf67fae"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"124b15ec-a492-4ee5-a6ad-2c695cf67fae": {"node_ids": ["97aa385b-691c-49eb-862b-eb6b1e08dfaa"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Touch_Screen_Devices\\Touch_Screen_Devices.htm"}}}}
