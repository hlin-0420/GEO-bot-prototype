Examples include shows, porosity, grain-size and sorting.\n\nGeo provides a visual indication of these values and builds the information into a database. This means that at any point the data is easily accessible for export.\n\nHistogram or Differential\n\nThe histogram type might be used to present porosity. If you click in a cell allocated \u2018Good\u2019 porosity, the cells to the left (Fair and Poor) would automatically be filled.\n\nThe differential type track does not automatically fill all cells to the left of the cell that is clicked. For this reason, you can record from one cell through to the maximum number of available cells at any one depth. The differential style might be used to present grain size where, if you click inside the \u2018Coarse\u2019 cell for instance, this does not mean that sample automatically has medium and fine characteristics.\n\n\n\nTo set up a Qualitative track:\n\nCreate a qualitative track \u2013 see creating a presentation or track.\n\nOn the Edit menu, select Track Settings. The Track Settings dialog box will open.\n\nSelect the qualitative track.\n\nSelect Details. The Qualitative Track Information dialog box will open. Here you can set up the qualitative track parameters based on the type of information you wish to record.\n\nEnter sampling interval in the Logging Frequency (for example 5ft).\n\nChoose Display Logging frequency lines.\n\nChoose to Display Horizontal Track Grids.\n\nFor Differential tracks;\n\nSelect Color Off. Select color tile that will represent \u2018no data\u2019, then click OK.\n\nIn the Differential Color on section, up to 30 rows can be defined to represent your active data points. Enter a Name and double click on the Color cell to define a color.\n\nUse Append and Insert to add more rows.\n\nTo alter the paint order, use the Up and Down buttons. For Histogram tracks;\n\nSelect Color on. Select the color tile that will represent active data points, then click OK.\n\nSelect Color Off. Select color tile that will represent \u2018no data\u2019, then click OK.\n\nEnter the number of parameters you wish to record in the Number of Graduations (for example, coarse, medium, and fine would be 3 graduations) and hit enter on your keyboard. The grid will populate with 3 rows.\n\nEnter a Graduation Name, Abbreviation and Value to be referenced when exporting the qualitative data.\n\nTo display vertical lines between each graduation, select Display Graduation Lines.\n\nDefine the display of the graduation legend by selecting from then Display in and Orientation boxes and the Font button.\n\nSelect OK to return to the Track Settings dialog box.
