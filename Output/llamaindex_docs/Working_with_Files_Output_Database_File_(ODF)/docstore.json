It contains all information needed for rapid recall of all data relating to a particular well, either for further editing/update or for recreating the log. The main components of an ODF are:\n\nAny loaded curve data and information about their source.\n\nLayout related information, such as tracks, and the log scale\n\nInformation about geological interpretation data, such as lithology, symbol and modifiers.\n\nInformation that you input, such as remarks, texts, tables and headers / trailers.\n\nAll libraries and fonts of the system in which the ODF was first created.\n\nEmbedded objects, such as documents, spreadsheets, maps, diagrams, photographs, etc.\n\nLinks to related external documents, such as reports, spreadsheets, photographs, other ODFs, etc.\n\nODF files may be shared with other members of the team (or with well partners) who require read-only access to the log and embedded curve data, using GEOView, or the free viewer, GEOe-View. For added security, an ODF must first be made e-View enabled before it can be opened by GEOe-View. The bottom status bar will state if the open ODF is e-View enabled or disabled. If disabled, right click on it and select e-View enabled. Both GEOView and GEOe-View can operate as \u2018plug-in\u2019 controls to the Internet Explorer web browser, so effectively allowing ODF files to be opened (normally by clicking a hyperlink to the ODF on an intranet web-page) within this standard browser. (If you are interested in setting-up a corporate intranet for securely-sharing your well data, please contact your local office of Geologix Limited. We shall be pleased to discuss your requirements and to offer our expertise within a range of service solutions).\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1935, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"8a000304-b494-4b25-9145-b737fbaea955": {"doc_hash": "3c91f0491a05c5b7a317fb14d1606fc5718b2466a5c7f7e5f760b0cbcb2fc62a", "ref_doc_id": "fcb4b721-d68a-4288-a265-619ac92a31f2"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"fcb4b721-d68a-4288-a265-619ac92a31f2": {"node_ids": ["8a000304-b494-4b25-9145-b737fbaea955"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Working_with_Files\\Output_Database_File_(ODF).htm"}}}}
