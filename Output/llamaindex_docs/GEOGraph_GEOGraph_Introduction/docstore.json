This Graphs can then be displayed in the header or trailer.\n\nUses can range from well trajectory plots through to pressure plots. Once the data is plotted, calculations of best-fit lines and line intersect can be achieved. This accompanied by full integration with GEO serves as a useful graphics tool.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore help on how to create and annotate a graph can be found in the help section accessed through GEOGraph. You may launch this application through the start menu by selecting Start > Programs > Geologix GEO Suite 8 > GEOGraph. Alternatively you may double-click any Graph file (.ggd) to invoke the program.\n\nBenefits of using GEOGraph\n\nThe focus throughout the GEO software Suite is to promote a minimal \u2018time and effort\u2019 logic. The GEO/GEOGraph integration is no different as once you have created your Graph and placed it in a header or trailer it becomes completely dynamic. Meaning if the data your graph is based on is changed or amended your GEOGraph document will automatically update. This can be as a result of editing or importing Curve or Table data.\n\nThis also means if your GEOGraph document is set up in a blank ODT for example, when you load in applicable data, the GEOGraph document will automatically populate with the data.\n\nYou can invoke GEOGraph within a GEO document by double-clicking on the GEOGraph document displayed in the header or trailer area.\n\nLearn how to add a graph (ggd file) to your ODF or ODT.\n\nAs part of the installation routine you will probably have installed a suite of example files and templates that have some example graphs already set up for you. Please feel free to experiment with these files and see how GEOGraph could benefit your well log.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1991, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"2c18b90d-799e-4798-9456-059978c15df0": {"doc_hash": "a0a492bdac8ad419f8408d6c86f15ab7f79bace43a2b765d2614bd2d7cdd118a", "ref_doc_id": "be25dfc3-8794-4fe6-804a-06bcf2df1878"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"be25dfc3-8794-4fe6-804a-06bcf2df1878": {"node_ids": ["2c18b90d-799e-4798-9456-059978c15df0"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\GEOGraph\\GEOGraph_Introduction.htm"}}}}
