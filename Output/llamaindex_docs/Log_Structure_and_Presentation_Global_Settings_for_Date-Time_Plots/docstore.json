Setting these values to the bounds of the date time range you want to display or print does NOT of course remove from the ODF database any stored data for the range outside of the bounds you have set. The active View settings are merely altered (until reset) to limit the scrollable or printable section of log to that date time range specified.\n\nDate Time Track Display Attributes\n\nDisplay Date Every - Check to display the date every Midnight, Month or None by checking appropriate radio button. The corresponding midnight/month time entry can be made to display on the line below the Date by checking the Display Time On a New Line check box.\n\nOrientation - Orientate the date and time values as Left to Right, Top to Bottom or Bottom to Top.\n\nFont - Select the font of the date time values.\n\nDate Format and Time Format - Define the date and time format. A preview of the format will display on the far right.\n\nUse Date Time format for Table - Check to use the Date and Time Format defined above for Date and Time table columns.\n\nTrack Edge - Define the thickness of the logs track edges. Normal is the same width as minor grids, Medium is slightly thicker and Wide are the thickest. Note. The actual appearance of Normal, Medium and Wide widths are defined by the settings in Display Pen Widths in the Options dialog box (on the Edit tab).\n\nCenter Line or Log Decade - Define the thickness of the center line of the linear tracks or log decade lines on the logarithmic tracks. Select Normal to make them the same thickness as the minor grids and Medium make them thicker than the minor grids. Note. The actual appearance of Normal and Medium widths are defined by the settings in Display Pen Widths in the Options dialog box (on the Edit tab).\n\nVertical Grid - customize the color of vertical grid lines.\n\nColor - Choose the color of the vertical grid lines.\n\nVertical Micro Grid (Log)\n\nColor - Choose the color of the mirco grid of logarithmic tracks.\n\nSolid or Dashed Line radio buttons - Choose the micro grids to be solid or dashed.\n\nZooms\n\nDisplay X and Y - Set the Display (screen) zoom.\n\nPrint X and Y - Set the Print zoom. Note. The default value of 1 is 100% zoom. To increase the zoom enter a value greater than 1. To reduce the zoom, enter a value less than 1. Note. The X (width of the plot) and Y (length of the plot) zooms can be altered independently. To maintain an aspect ratio, keep them the same. Tip. If you increase or decrease the Print Zoom factor (for both X and Y), the plot scale needs to be increased or decreased by the same factor in order to maintain the correct scale in the print. For example, if applying a 1.5 Print X and Y to a 1 : 60 minute log, the scale should be adjusted to 1 : 90.\n\nHorizontal Tracktext Font Scaling - When the plot scale changes, it can cause horizontal text entries (normally descriptions) to overlap and become cut off, preventing the whole text entry from being viewed. To prevent this, use the following controls to resize the text when the scale changes.\n\nCurrent Scale Factor - Displays the factor by which the horizontal track text has been reduced to compensate for the changed scale.\n\nCompute whenever Plot Scale changes - Check to automatically change the text font size when the scale changes.\n\nVertical Track Text Font Scale - When the plot scale changes, it can cause vertical track text entries (normally the chrono and litho stratigraphy) to overlap. To prevent this, enter the factor by which the vertical track text has to be reduced to compensate for the changed scale.\n\nScale & Grid Tab\n\nThis tab controls scale and date-time settings.\n\nSelect a Scale Setting - From the drop list, select a predefined scale or use the boxes below to define a new scale.\n\nScreen Units - Set the screen units to Inches (imperial) or Millimeters (metric).

Use the check box to control its display.\n\nDouble Major Grid - Enter the time frequency at which the Double Major Grid will display - this must be equal to or greater than the Major Grid, and a multiple of the Minor Grid. Use the check box to control its display.\n\nDisplay Cutoffs for Scale - If the scale of the plot is changed considerably, many small lithology units and vertical track text elements are compressed, and the screen view and print will appear unclear. To eradicate this, you can specify a minimum time range display for Lithology and vertical Track Text elements for a selected compressed scale. Any lithology block or vertical track text, whose time range is less than the cutoff range, will not be displayed at the selected plot scale.\n\nCutoff Height for Lithology and Vertical Track Text - Enter the minimum time range for lithology / vertical track text to be displayed.\n\nDisplay Modifiers - Check to display modifiers at the compressed scale.\n\nCutoff Weight for Track Text, Free Format, Symbols - Enter the cutoff weight for the track text, free format text and symbols.

By default, this is set to 20 minutes. At each set time interval, GEO will save a copy of your work-to-date to back-up file in the default or specified Back-up Directory. Should GEO or your system abnormally terminate (due to power failure or program crash), you will only lose data that changed since the last auto-save. You will be presented with the option of re-loading your work from the back-up file on re-launching a session of GEO. On normal termination of the application, the Back-up directory is flushed (deleted), ready for the next session. Note. If the value entered in this box is too small, it may cause inconvenience by frequent interruptions while the software creates a backup, especially when the file is large. On the other hand, if the set time is too large, you may encounter a higher risk of losing more of your work, if the system terminates abnormally. Warning. Do not use this AutoSave feature as the only means of backup for you file. Always manually backup your ODF file to a different media or place or storage.\n\nSetting of Wrap Curves - When a curve that is plotted on a track has a value, which falls outside the scale range assigned for that curve, you may wish to wrap the curve around (i.e. to present the back-up curves). Set the following attributes for wrapped curves.\n\nMaxium number of times to Wrap a Curve - Set the maximum number of times a curve may wrap around. Note. A curve can wrap a maximum of 50 times.\n\nAutomatic Selection of Wrap Pen Type for Curves - Dictates whether or not GEO selects the corresponding \u2018thick\u2019 pen style, following the user\u2019s selection of the normal pen type (in Display > Pens tab of the Curve Settings side bar). Should this checkbox be selected, when you select a dashed pen (No. 1) for the Normal Pen, GEO would automatically select the thick dashed pen (No. 11) for the Wrap Pen.\n\nAutomatic Selection of Wrap Pens Color for Curves - Dictates whether or not GEO selects the matching color for the wrap pen, following the color selection for the normal pen. By default, both Automatic selection of Wrap Pen Type and Color for Curves check boxes are cleared or unchecked .\n\nRotate Zone Report Output display in Horizontal View - Select to allow zone reports to rotate when the plot is viewed horizontally so that they can be read in the new left-right text orientation.\n\nTimezone-offset of the well (hours from UTC) - Enter the time zone offset for the well. When loading data from a WITSML server this offset will be applied.\n\nDepth Tick Lengths - Specify the length of depth ticks on the plot.\n\nTick lengths are divided into the same categories as for the Grid lines (see grid line information in the Scale & Grid tab of Global Settings).\n\nMinor Grid - Specify the length of the depth tick that corresponds to the minor grid.\n\nMajor Grid - Specify the length of the depth tick that corresponds to the major grid.\n\nDouble Major Grid - Specify the length of the depth tick that corresponds to the double major grid.\n\nLegends - Adjust the Curve and Track legends height.\n\nTrack Legend Height - Define the height of the track legend.\n\nGap Between Curve Legends - Define the distance between curve legends. Note. The height and gap unit - mm or inch - depends on the specified screen unit (in Scale & Grid tab).\n\nCurve Font and Track Font- Select the preferred font size and style for both the curves and track legends.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6429, "end_char_idx": 11012, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"e8e2831b-b269-4c1b-9f1a-6c4083c01790": {"doc_hash": "8d9c4077ce99272dc8b6bb4558c3399c8c56004d2f9095c45ed7bd758c33ed19", "ref_doc_id": "ef602310-2145-48d1-86b4-394a814cef5c"}, "6f7c6d49-2eca-45de-92bf-e043b54a7663": {"doc_hash": "28e192e8c87f5bb16f3b7a00345e2308713ed369e948e66254716954693ee0de", "ref_doc_id": "ef602310-2145-48d1-86b4-394a814cef5c"}, "707312c5-d7aa-4eab-bdfe-651adebee2b0": {"doc_hash": "aa36c6ac83b185c81d9c9a27b6469d86fbf87a5e899a53d5f5ff0be5c5b81a58", "ref_doc_id": "ef602310-2145-48d1-86b4-394a814cef5c"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"ef602310-2145-48d1-86b4-394a814cef5c": {"node_ids": ["e8e2831b-b269-4c1b-9f1a-6c4083c01790", "6f7c6d49-2eca-45de-92bf-e043b54a7663", "707312c5-d7aa-4eab-bdfe-651adebee2b0"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Log_Structure_and_Presentation\\Global_Settings_for_Date-Time_Plots.htm"}}}}
