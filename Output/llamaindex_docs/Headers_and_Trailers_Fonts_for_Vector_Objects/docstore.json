When the software displays or prints text from any VOB file, it uses the font that has been specified in the VOB file.\n\nThe way the defined VOB fonts will appear in the plot is specified in the Fonts for Vector Objects. To open this, on the Define tab, select Fonts - VOBs.\n\nIf text in a header is created with font number 5, which is Arial 10 bold, it may look different on another PC that has Arial 6 regular as its font number 5.\n\nYou can use this dialog box to change the font type and size for this number 5 font, to get the same text fonts on both PCs.\n\nWhen you receive an ODF file from another user, displaying the Fonts for Vector Objects will give information on the fonts that the other person uses. Therefore, this dialog box gives a fingerprint of how the VOB fonts were defined in the other session of the software, which has been used to create the ODF.\n\n\n\nFont list\n\nDetails all fonts currently defined for Vector Objects. Each line briefly describes a single font. Select a font from this box prior to changing its attributes such as its type, size and orientation.\n\nThe number on the left is the font number. It is used to reference the font in VOB files.\n\nThe number is then followed by the font type (e.g. Arial).\n\nThe following number in parenthesis specifies the size of the font. The size may appear in two different formats points or height.\n\nWhen the format appears as height (e.g.12 height), it is the default definition of the font and specifies the complete height of the font including internal leading.\n\nIf this font is selected from this dialog box and updated using Choose Font, the size is converted to a point size which does not include internal leading. So a font with a height of 12 would appear as 9 points.\n\nThis size is then followed by the font style, such as regular, bold or italic.\n\nLine Orientation\n\nShows the orientation of a line of text in the currently selected font.\n\nSelecting a different orientation affects all text that uses the currently selected font.\n\nCharacter Orientation\n\nDictates the character orientation\n\nSelecting Fonts\n\nClick Choose Font to open the Font dialog box where you can change the font type, style, size and color.\n\nClick Default Font to restore the default font settings as specified in the Text-Fonts tab in the Registry Editor dialog box.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2758, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"da4fb14b-ced7-462a-b4e6-f03d1af6ef12": {"doc_hash": "315c3ab41dc481bc67564c4d442dea91f051ca6f53476dbbc78c621c55999a1c", "ref_doc_id": "8bb757a8-efe5-4623-b323-e40dab5408b3"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"8bb757a8-efe5-4623-b323-e40dab5408b3": {"node_ids": ["da4fb14b-ced7-462a-b4e6-f03d1af6ef12"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\Headers_and_Trailers\\Fonts_for_Vector_Objects.htm"}}}}
