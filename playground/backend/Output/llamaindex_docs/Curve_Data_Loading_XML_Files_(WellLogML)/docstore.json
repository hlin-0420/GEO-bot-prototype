However, the information within the XML file is structured differently so viewing the files contents prior to importing is slightly different. This specific structuring is called WellLogML.\n\nWellLogML is similar to LAS, in that it specifies how well log data is organized in terms of Well Information, Curve Information, Parameter Information, etc.\n\nFor more information about XML as a file format, please review the section on Exporting Curve Data to XML Format, where we have links to relevant official websites on the subject.\n\nOn the GEO tab, select Import. The Open dialog box will open.\n\nSelect the XML file and Open. The WellLogML Information dialog box will open. This contains 3 tabs; Global, Parameters and Curves.\n\nGlobal General information contained within the XML file is detailed. File name and path, related File ID and Data depth parameters are all included. You may enter information on the authors or suppliers of the XML file in the field marked Vendor name. The vendor name will appear in the Curve Data History. Start and End Depths are filled in automatically as is the Sampling mode, Depth Increment, Units and the File Naming System. The table window near the bottom of the dialog box contains the XML Tags and their corresponding XML value. The XML Tag is taken from the original data set. The information displayed here can be compared to the Well Information section of a LAS file. The Tag is essentially the title of the data, for example Well Name would be a common tag to appear here. You then get the opportunity to supply a mnemonic to this tag. The mnemonic used in the ODF can then be assigned to this tag and the XML value for that tag can therefore be applied to the specified mnemonic.\n\nParameters This table displays Parameter-Mnemonic information from the WellLogML file: the mnemonic, its Unit, Description and Value.\n\nCurves Information on the curves that you wish to load are displayed here. The Curve Mnemonic, Unit, Name and Description along with Null Value are listed for each curve within the XML file. The last column, Load?, gives you the opportunity to deselect any curves that you do not wish to load. By default all curves within the XML file will be loaded. To deselect a curve, click the cell in the Load column for that curve (row) and type \u2018N\u2019. Type the letter \u2018Y\u2019 for yes if you decide to again load the curve.\n\nSelect Apply to save any changes, then OK to load.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2659, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"b8706056-226f-4cf2-928a-17bead4317d1": {"doc_hash": "a9caa357ed1ec9f66fc7b77e17a3d3a682b6fcede0e57dec4cd502a58f7480e1", "ref_doc_id": "4664389f-83e0-4b58-9f08-a9aae30a85d6"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"4664389f-83e0-4b58-9f08-a9aae30a85d6": {"node_ids": ["b8706056-226f-4cf2-928a-17bead4317d1"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\raw_data\\Curve_Data\\Loading_XML_Files_(WellLogML).htm"}}}}
