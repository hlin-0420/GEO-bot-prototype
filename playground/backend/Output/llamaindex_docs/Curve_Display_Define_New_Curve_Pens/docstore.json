In each such segment, up to ten pixels can be turned on and up to another ten pixels can be turned off.\n\nFor example, a solid line could be defined either as:\n\na single segment, 1 dot on, zero dots off\n\na single segment, 2 dots on, zero dots off\n\nfive segments, each with 10 dots on, zero dots off\n\nNote. Pens consisting of longer definitions (all five segments defined, for example) draw more efficiently than those with shorter definitions (only one segment defined).\n\nSince there is a large difference in the resolutions (pixels/dots per inch) between display-devices and printer-devices, the software has two different definitions for the same pen: one for the display-device and the other for the printer-device.\n\nFor example, the display-definition of a dash pen might consist of four pixels on, four pixels off, four pixels on, and so on while the printer-definition of the same dash pen might consist of ten pixels on, ten pixels off, ten pixels on, and so on. The number difference is due to the generally higher resolution on the printer than the monitor (display).\n\nAnother important attribute of a pen is its type. This attribute determines the thickness (and the shape) of a pen. The software currently supports the following pen-types:\n\nSingle pixel\n\nTwo, three, four or five pixels side-by-side.\n\nA square two, three, four or five pixels on each side.\n\nDefine a New Curve Pen\n\nOn the Curves tab, select Curve Settings. The Curve Settings sidebar will open.\n\nOn the Display tab, open the Pens node.\n\nSelect the Use Customized Pens double arrow. The Pen Definition dialog box will open.\n\nSelect an unused number in the Select Pen box.\n\nEnter a Pen Name (e.g. DotDashDash)\n\nSelect the Pen Type for both the display and printing pens.\n\nEnter the number of Pixels On and Pixels Off for both then display and printing pens. Note. It is recommended that you enter the values for all 5 rows, to create a five-segment of dot combination pen (see Theory above).\n\nSelect Draw Sample to preview the new pen in the Sample box.\n\nSelect Update to implement the changes.\n\nTip. The new pen definition can be saved in a View (Vew) file.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2795, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"483cccae-4c02-4f51-b2b4-6142bee0413a": {"doc_hash": "fd09d4fc434df8f83fc93f7c0584fbe44a6ec431865045b543bf27524db5d70c", "ref_doc_id": "8170677a-a930-496b-a2c2-7dadddac6935"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"8170677a-a930-496b-a2c2-7dadddac6935": {"node_ids": ["483cccae-4c02-4f51-b2b4-6142bee0413a"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\visualization\\Curve_Display\\Define_New_Curve_Pens.htm"}}}}
