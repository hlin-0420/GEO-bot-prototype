This is because in a metafile, shapes can be defined as a mathematical formula rather than as a conglomeration of dots.\n\nThe other advantage is that a metafile usually requires less disk space than a corresponding bitmap.\n\nYou can export the complete plot, or any section of it, to the following formats.\n\nCGM - Computer Graphics Metafiles (Binary format)\n\nWMF - Standard Windows Metafile\n\nPlaceable WMF\n\nWMF - Metafile Picture to Clipboard\n\nEMF - Enhanced Metafile\n\nEMF - Enhanced Metafile using Screen Settings\n\nEMF - Enhanced Metafile to clipboard\n\nTIFF - Tagged Image Format\n\nSVG - Scaleable Vector Graphics\n\nExport Plot as an Image\n\nOn the Export tab, select Export As... then select the image format you wish to export to. Note. If saving to clipboard, for example EMF to Clipboard, you can now paste it into another application.\n\nEnter a File name and path where the output will be stored.\n\nClick Save.\n\nNote. The default path for these exported files depends on the type of metafile output selected.\n\nThe default path for WMF and CGM are defined at the File Locations tab in the Registry Editor dialog box (opened by selecting Edit GEO Settings from the Edit tab) and can be changed, as required.\n\nGEO will use the device driver to obtain the horizontal resolution (pixels per inch), vertical resolution (pixels per inch), page size (pixels) and text formatting information.\n\nWe recommend you install a suitable printer driver for just this purpose, as our experience has shown that certain printer-drivers are poor at creating metafiles.\n\nWe recommend use of the printer-driver for the EPSON STYLUS 1520 COLOR printer for optimum metafile creation.\n\nAn up-to-date driver may be downloaded from the EPSON website at https://www.epson.co.uk/support?productID=3838&os=22#drivers_and_manuals", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2419, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"89a53ac9-21b3-42d0-9133-bcaf3ec068bf": {"doc_hash": "ab69d59b099c4866144e5091a82cf34418856c84cdaeac8c8a96ed8f38c9f707", "ref_doc_id": "9143bb09-c14a-43bd-b7e5-b1be25f74e37"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"9143bb09-c14a-43bd-b7e5-b1be25f74e37": {"node_ids": ["89a53ac9-21b3-42d0-9133-bcaf3ec068bf"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\introduction\\Sharing\\Export_Data_and_Information\\Export_to_Image_File\\Export_GEO_Plot_as_Image.htm"}}}}
