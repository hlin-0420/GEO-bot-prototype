This can be invoked by selecting View Event Log from the GEO tab.\n\nEvents are listed in a chronological order, applying a date and time stamp for each. The following are included in the event log:\n\nODF file load\n\nSave\n\nOUF creation\n\nLog on as a new user name\n\nDepth shift the curves\n\nNote. A new save event would not be created every time you save the ODF file. If one user saved a file multiple times in one day, only one save event would be recorded. The date and time field would simply update and record the most recent time saved. The next day however, the first save would invoke a new file save event. If multiple users saved files multiple times in one day, a save event would be recorded for each user detailing the most recent time saved.\n\nThe event log details the following information.\n\nStart and end data depth (relating to the data load event).\n\nThe name of the User who logged on to the software at the time of the \u2018event\u2019.\n\nDate and time of the \u2018event\u2019.\n\nThe Error column that details any GEO error \u2018message number\u2019 should an error occur during a file load or save episode. If no error occurs this value will show zero.\n\nDescription. This information depends on the \u2018event\u2019. If it were a file load episode for example, the description would detail the \u2018Number of data columns that were loaded\u2019, \u2018File path\u2019, \u2018File name\u2019, \u2018GEO license number\u2019 and whether the curves were appended. Relating to a file save, the description will detail the directory saved to and the file name.\n\nClick Print to print the event log using the printer that you have setup through the Print Setup.\n\nNote. The user can resize this dialog box, as well as the widths of the data-table columns. The next time this dialog box is invoked, it will use the last-sized width (also the data-table columns).\n\n\u21b5\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2134, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"f6104a83-dcdc-4831-ba36-f27a260a29c1": {"doc_hash": "c5c50fa1b1869bf8bbe5ce49f278b47583cd07b1f5a97d65f798ea6e528dfe46", "ref_doc_id": "108593f3-486a-4bde-838c-27730560755b"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"108593f3-486a-4bde-838c-27730560755b": {"node_ids": ["f6104a83-dcdc-4831-ba36-f27a260a29c1"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\introduction\\Sharing\\Event_Log.htm"}}}}
