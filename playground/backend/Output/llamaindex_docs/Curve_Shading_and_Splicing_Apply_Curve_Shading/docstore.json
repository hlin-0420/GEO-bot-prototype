The Curve Shading Information dialog box will open.\n\nFrom Curve Shading, select an unused curve number. Tip. Up to 250 shadings can be applied in one ODF.\n\nSelect Display Curve Shade to display the shading on the plot.\n\nEnter a Name.\n\nSelect the Track where the curve shading will apply.\n\nTick Cover track Grids to shade over the plot grid. Un-tick to display grids over the shading.\n\nIn Shade From, specify the starting point of the shading by selecting a curve, fixed value or corresponding track edge.\n\nIn To, specify the end shading point by selecting a curve, fixed value or corresponding track edge. Note. If <fixed curve value> is selected either as start or end shading point, the value needs to be specified in Fixed Curve Value.\n\nClick Append to define a shading interval and its pattern through the Zone Attributes grid. This grid is used to select the shading\u2019s fill type, color, and depth range over which the shade will occur.\n\nEnter the shading depth interval in the From Depth and To Depth columns. Note. To select the entire curve interval, leave From Depth as 0 and To Depth as 99999. This allows the curve shading to extend automatically, for instance, when subsequent curves are appended to those existing at the time of setting-up that curve shade.\n\nSelect the shading Type.\n\nColor: Solid single color for the entire shading. Double-click the Left Color column. The Color dialog box will open. Select or mix your shading color.\n\nPattern: Lithology pattern as defined in your ODF Lithology library. Select the lithology pattern from the Pattern column. Note. Not all printers are capable of support the shading with lithology pattern option. Warning: With this current version of GEO, the shading of lithology pattern cannot be exported to CGM yet.\n\nRGB -> RGB: Color degradation from left to the right. Double click the Left Color followed by the Right Color columns, so you can select different colors between left and right edge of shading.\n\nHue Fill: Change in Hue from left to right.\n\nSaturation Fill: Saturation degradation/intensity increase.\n\nLuminosity Fill: Luminosity coloration changes (greyscale).\n\nNone: No shading\n\nRGB>RGB (vertical): Color gradation vertically based on zone attributes. Note. Each row in zone attributes represents a shade from one color to the next, based on the discriminating curve. See below.\n\nSelect Update to apply the changes.\n\nCurve Shade based on discriminating Curve\n\nThe shading can be based on particular curve values, either by defining shading zones based on those curve values, or by referencing a curve composed of RGB data.\n\nFrom Shade based on discriminating curve, select the corresponding curve.\n\nTick Data the contains RGB Values if your curve consists of RGB values.\n\nSelect Data Value Ranges defined below if you with to define shading zones. Note. If you select <Curve from Mnemonic> the radio buttons will not enable and the Data Value Ranges defined below will be selected by default. A new drop list will appear from with you can select the Mnemonic.\n\nThe shading interval in the Zone Attributes grid will change to From Value and To Value (instead of From Depth and To Depth).\n\nTo shade only the wrapped (or out-of scale) curve, select the Wrapped check box next to the curve that you want to shade. Please click here for more information on how to shade only the wrapped curves.\n\nTips. To delete shading from the plot, select the Curve Shading and clear Display Curve Shade on Layout, then Update. Although all names remain on this dialog box for later re-selection, the shading is removed from the plot. To totally remove the settings click Reset.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4090, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"050fae0a-4c92-4905-857c-30b65b67b515": {"doc_hash": "e28d6bd0182a2259716e58a4a0539d8b0826af3443b090af406e2c55944bd814", "ref_doc_id": "e45716d1-c302-46b1-93fc-8dce7bf481d2"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"e45716d1-c302-46b1-93fc-8dce7bf481d2": {"node_ids": ["050fae0a-4c92-4905-857c-30b65b67b515"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\visualization\\Curve_Shading_and_Splicing\\Apply_Curve_Shading.htm"}}}}
