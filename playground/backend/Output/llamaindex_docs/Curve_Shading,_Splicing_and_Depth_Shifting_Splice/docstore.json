The selected source curve is spliced onto the destination curve over the specified depth interval.\n\nIn general, the splicing operation is appropriate only for wireline curves. This is because each wireline curve has its own first and last reading and curves need to be spliced to eliminate or minimize data falling outside these points.\n\nThe File ID of a spliced curve is [Spliced], indicating that the data is not original. You are only able to splice curves into [Unused] or [Spliced] destinations so that the original data is left intact in case a spliced curve needs to be recreated with different splice points.\n\nMudlog data, on the other hand, should be appended rather than spliced as the data provided on a daily basis from the mudloggers constitute part of a continuous data-set.\n\nHowever, sometimes, to satisfy the requirement of presenting ROP with different scales over different zones, the one ROP curve may be split up into the different zones using the splice function.\n\nClick here to learn how to append the curves.\n\nOn the Curves tab, select Splice. The Curve Splicing dialog box will open.\n\nSelect a curve from Source Curve. The depth range of the curve will be displayed at the side.\n\nIn Select range to copy enter the start and end depth respectively. The depth range entered must be the same or a subset of the source curve depth range.\n\nSelect a curve from Destination Curve on to which the source curve will be spliced. Initially, the destination curve must be an [Unused] one.\n\nClick Splice. The curve in Destination Curve will then bear the same mnemonic as the source curve and have a File ID of [Spliced].\n\nAnother Source Curve can be selected and a new data set can be spliced, by leaving the Destination Curve the same as what you have in step 5.\n\nClick Splice to then splice two different curves from the Source Curve into one curve (as specified in the Destination Curve).\n\nIf the source curve is being copied onto an existing curve, and there is an overlap between the source and destination curves, a dialog box will be presented.\n\nYes: overwrites the overlapping section of the destination curve with source curve values.\n\nNo: retains the destination curve values over the section of the overlap.\n\nCancel: aborts the operation.\n\nThe above process may be repeated on the same destination curve with other source curves.\n\nTip. Select Index Converter to calculate the different depth values (in MD, TVD, TVDSS, TWT and VSEC) for a specific depth without exiting the dialog box.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2735, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"948251a1-e982-4ad1-a53d-20cdee70eada": {"doc_hash": "8383d6775657598716d366405837c4189f525a8ff98075a1eea724faa9e55061", "ref_doc_id": "b6dd34c1-3303-4107-85d9-e427e4a0f023"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"b6dd34c1-3303-4107-85d9-e427e4a0f023": {"node_ids": ["948251a1-e982-4ad1-a53d-20cdee70eada"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\visualization\\Curve_Shading,_Splicing_and_Depth_Shifting\\Splice.htm"}}}}
