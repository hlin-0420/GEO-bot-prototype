(Please refer to the help within that application for further details).\n\nTo export all other data, except for the curve data, using the Export All Information feature. This is explained below.\n\nNote. To export the curve data to LAS, Text-tab delimited or Comma-tab delimited format, please use the Export Curve Data feature\n\nExport All Information\n\nThis feature allows you to select specific ODF components (or objects) to be exported from GEO, since not all objects in an ODF may need to be exported.\n\nFor example, although a box around text is a symbol, it has no relevance to geology. Similarly, in a long sequence the age-dating column may have the word JURASSIC repeated several times. Only one of the text blocks signifies the correct interval. This dialog box shows total number of the items in an ODF file and allows you to choose what to be exported from GEO.\n\nUse the following procedure to export the data from GEO through an intermediary text-form file:\n\nOpen the ODF containing the data to be exported.\n\nOn the Export tab select All Info. The Select Items to Export will open.\n\nObjects with the check box selected will be exported. If you do not want to export an object, clear the check box.\n\nAt each object, you will see the total number of that item in the ODF and the number of selected elements to be exported. By default, all total numbers will be exported.\n\nClicking Select at each item brings up the items\u2019 list, allowing you to select a particular item of that object to be exported. The total number of the selected items of each object will be written under the Selected column.\n\nClick Export. The Export As dialog box will open.\n\nEnter a File name and select a folder to save to.\n\nClick Save to start exporting the selected objects from GEO.\n\nThe \u2018logical block\u2019 of the text (TXT) file as the Export All Info result is shown below.\n\nA semicolon (\";\") as the first token in a line denotes a comment-line, which has been inserted only for the purpose of readability.\n\nEach block begins with a BEGIN keyword, followed by the type of the block; a block always ends with an END keyword.\n\nThe Global block is always the first block in the file.\n\nThe depth values will always be represented in the fixed-point notation.\n\nThe mnemonic-name will always be four characters long.\n\nThe symbol-type, modifier-type and litho-type will be the (up to) eight-character names as they appear in GEO.\n\nThe free-format text and track text field will consist of a text-length field followed by a \":\" character and then the text-value. A single <CR> character denotes a new-line.\n\nHere is an example of the \u2018logical block\u2019 format of a TXT file, as am Export All Info result.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3282, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"e13e957b-3227-4cd1-b2b3-f4c16e100936": {"doc_hash": "5a3ad601c40d77d5919add63e2d5b028c4e0075a474ab0d51ac6cc589b9fba53", "ref_doc_id": "b55aaa02-80b3-487f-aba7-62f60e8fd33d"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"b55aaa02-80b3-487f-aba7-62f60e8fd33d": {"node_ids": ["e13e957b-3227-4cd1-b2b3-f4c16e100936"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\introduction\\Sharing\\Export_Data_and_Information\\Export_All_Other_Data_(except_curve_data).htm"}}}}
