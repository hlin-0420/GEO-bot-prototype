Note. Setting these values to the bounds of the depth range you want to display or print does NOT of course remove from the ODF database, any stored data for the range outside of the bounds you have set. The active view settings are merely altered (until reset) to limit the scrollable or printable section of log to that depth range specified. Note. If you specify the Plot Depths From as 0, when a data set starting from 1000 ft is loaded, the plot will start from 1000 ft, instead of 0 ft. However, if the Plot Depths From is greater than 0 ft (but less than 1000 ft), the plot will start from this specified depth, when the same data set (also started from 1000 ft) is loaded.\n\nPrimary and Alternate Depth Display Attributes - You can display up to two depth systems on the plot; a Primary and Alternate depth system.\n\nOrientation - Choose the orientation of both primary and alternate depth values from the drop list - it can be set to Left to Right, Top to Bottom or Bottom to Top.\n\nFont - Specify the depth value font.\n\nPrimary and Alternate Depth System - Assign the depth system - MD, TVD, TWT or VSEC - of the Primary and Alternate Depth System.\n\nTVD - If a TVD curve has been assigned to be used for TVD conversion, you can control how and when it displays.\n\nTVDSS Correction - Enter a sub sea correction to display the TVD depth system as TVDSS.\n\nDisplay TVDSS as Negative (-) - Check to display the TVDSS values with a minus sign before the depth value.\n\nUse the TVDSS Correction - Check to display the TVDSS values on the plot. This will replace the TVD value displayed on the plot.\n\nDisplay TVD values every MD for Highly Deviated Sections - Check to display TVD/TVDSS values for every MD values available in highly deviated sections of the well.\n\nTrack Edge - Choose to display the track edge thickness as Normal, Medium or Wide. Note. The actual appearance of Normal, Medium and Wide widths are defined by the settings in Display Pen Widths in the Options dialog box on the Edit tab.\n\nCenter Line or Log Decade - Choose to display the track Centre Line (if displaying - controlled in the Track Settings dialog box) or Log Decade thickness as Normal or Medium.\n\nVertical Grid - Control the Color of the vertical grid lines.\n\nVertical Micro Grid (Log)\n\nColor - Choose the color of the mirco grid of logarithmic tracks.\n\nSolid or Dashed Line radio buttons - Choose the micro grids to be solid or dashed.\n\nZooms\n\nDisplay X and Y - Set the Display (screen) zoom.\n\nPrint X and Y - Set the Print zoom. Note. The default value of 1 is 100% zoom. To increase the zoom enter a value greater than 1. To reduce the zoom, enter a value less than 1. Note. The X (width of the plot) and Y (length of the plot) zooms can be altered independently. To maintain an aspect ratio, keep them the same. Tip. If you increase the Print Zoom factor (for both X and Y) to 1.5, to maintain the log scale as 1:500 at the hard copy, you need to change the plot vertical scale to 1 : (500 / 1.5) or 1 : 333.\n\nHorizontal Tracktext Font Scaling - When the plot scale changes, it can cause horizontal text entries (normally descriptions) to overlap and become cut off, preventing the whole text entry from being viewed. To prevent this, use the following controls to resize the text when the scale changes.\n\nCurrent Scale Factor - Displays the factor by which the horizontal track text has been reduced to compensate for the changed scale.\n\nCompute whenever Plot Scale changes - Check to automatically change the text font size when the scale changes.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4276, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95abf655-c776-4f3a-b72b-dc1d5502abf1": {"__data__": {"id_": "95abf655-c776-4f3a-b72b-dc1d5502abf1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\layout\\Log_Structure_and_Presentation\\Global_Settings_for_Depth_Plots.htm"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e04e8dfc-aaa2-463e-ac24-f2842160b1f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\layout\\Log_Structure_and_Presentation\\Global_Settings_for_Depth_Plots.htm"}, "hash": "c3d524bbe6478204d2894d1b6e446b10e00e795e934f0825fae4acc68d2348bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8c29e19-0490-4d6f-9b33-554ce9711e0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\layout\\Log_Structure_and_Presentation\\Global_Settings_for_Depth_Plots.htm"}, "hash": "8653e2d1fc298c81aaed797872a0f16e9896dca8da06d55252fb91e144bf1eac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "537be21e-397d-4d6a-8b19-c770001ca175", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d87f81da8cc4846e0422a7b9475f8f7f7e8032ed819465e432e398a0c6165cf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The X (width of the plot) and Y (length of the plot) zooms can be altered independently.

Note. Any screen unit value used by GEO, will be altered to this chosen unit. This includes the mouse co-ordinate values on the status bar and the track edge position values.\n\nScreen Units - Set the screen units to Inches (imperial) or Millimeters (metric).\n\nIndex Units - Set to Feet or Meters.\n\nDisplay Cutoffs for Scale - If the scale of the plot is changed considerably, for example a 1:500 plot is converted to 1:10000, many small lithology units and vertical track text elements become compressed and the screen view and prints can appear unclear. To eradicate this, you can specify a minimum depth range display for Lithology and vertical Track Text elements for a selected compressed scale. Any lithology block or vertical track text, whose depth range is less than the cutoff range, will not be displayed at the selected plot scale.\n\nCutoff Height for Lithology and Vertical Track Text - Enter the minimum depth range for lithology / vertical track text to be displayed.\n\nDisplay Modifiers - Check to display modifiers at the compressed scale.\n\nCutoff Weight for Track Text, Free Format, Symbols - Enter the cutoff weight for the track text, free format text and symbols. If any of these has a weight value less than the value defined, they will not be display when the plot scale is compressed.\n\nDepth Values - By default the depth values, which display in the depth track, display every 100ft or 100m. To change this, type the new value here. Note. The value must be a multiple of the Minor Grid interval.\n\nMinor, Major and Double Major Grid - On the plot, there are Minor, Major and Double Major horizontal grid lines. The depth interval at which these display can be customized, but their values must be multiples of each other and the Depth Values.\n\nMinor Grid - Enter the minor grid interval here.\n\nMajor Grid - Enter the major grid interval here.\n\nDouble Major Grid - Enter the double major grid interval here.\n\nMinor Grid attributes\n\nColor - Choose the color of the minor grid lines.\n\nSolid or Dashed radio buttons - Choose for the minor grid line to be solid or dashed.\n\nMajor Grid attributes\n\nColor - Choose the color of the major grid lines.\n\nDouble Major Grid attributes\n\nColor - Choose the color of the double major grid.\n\nCutoff Horizontal Segment Length - Control the length of the horizontal segments of the Cutoff Curves.

By default, this is set to 20 minutes. At each set time interval, GEO will save a copy of your work-to-date to back-up file in the default or specified Back-up Directory. Should GEO or your system abnormally terminate (due to power failure or program crash), you will only lose data that has changed since the last auto-save. You will be presented with the option of re-loading your work from the back-up file on re-launching a session of GEO. On normal termination of the application, the Back-up directory is flushed (deleted), ready for the next session. Note. If the value entered in this box is too small, it may cause inconvenience by frequent interruptions while the software creates a backup, especially when the file is large. On the other hand, if the set time is too large, you may encounter a higher risk of losing more of your work, if the system terminates abnormally. Warning. Do not use this AutoSave feature as the only means of backup for you file. Always manually backup your ODF file to a different media or place of storage.\n\nAuto Merge OUFs every - Enter the frequency (in minutes) at which you want GEO to check for new OUF files and automerge them into the child ODF. Please click here for further information on this feature. Note. By default, this feature is disabled as the frequency is set at 0 (zero) minutes.\n\nSetting of Wrap Curves - When a curve that is plotted on a track has a value, which falls outside the scale range assigned for that curve, you may wish to wrap the curve around (i.e. to present the back-up curves). Set the following attributes for wrapped curves.\n\nMaximum number of times to Wrap a Curve - Set the maximum number of times a curve may wrap around. Note. A curve can wrap a maximum of 50 times.\n\nAutomatic Selection of Wrap Pen Type for Curves - Dictates whether or not GEO selects the corresponding \u2018thick\u2019 pen style, following the user\u2019s selection of the normal pen type (in Display > Pens tab of the Curve Settings side bar). Should this checkbox be selected, when you select a dashed pen (No. 1) for the Normal Pen, GEO would automatically select the thick dashed pen (No. 11) for the Wrap Pen.\n\nAutomatic Selection of Wrap Pens Color for Curves - Dictates whether or not GEO selects the matching color for the wrap pen, following the color selection for the normal pen. By default, both Automatic selection of Wrap Pen Type and Color for Curves check boxes are cleared or unchecked.\n\nAllow this ODF to be opened by GEOe-View - Select to allow data sharing and collaboration with other people using GEOe-View, the free-of-charge file viewer which is downloadable from our website.\n\nRotate Zone Report Output display in Horizontal View - Select to allow zone reports to rotate when the plot is viewed horizontally so that they can be read in the left-right text orientation.\n\nTimezone-offset of the well (hours from UTC) - Enter the time zone offset for the well. When loading data from a WITSML server this offset will be applied.\n\nRestrict Index Range for Autoloads to - Allows you to define the amount of data (in depth terms) that is loaded at any one time into your log, upon autoload.\n\nDepth Shift Label Font - Define the font for the Depth Shift labels.\n\nZone Label Font - Define the font for the Zone labels.\n\nDepth Tick Lengths - Specify the length of depth ticks on the plot.\n\nTick lengths are divided into the same categories as for the Grid lines (see grid line information above in the Scale & Grid tab of Global Settings).\n\nMinor Grid - Specify the length of the depth tick that corresponds to the minor grid.\n\nMajor Grid - Specify the length of the depth tick that corresponds to the major grid.\n\nDouble Major Grid - Specify the length of the depth tick that corresponds to the double major grid.\n\nLegends - Adjust the Curve and Track legends height.\n\nTrack Legend Height - Define the height of the track legend.\n\nGap Between Curve Legends - Define the distance between curve legends. Note. The height and gap unit - mm or inch - depends on the specified screen unit (in Scale & Grid tab).\n\nCurve Font and Track Font - Select the preferred font size and style for both the curves and track legends.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6390, "end_char_idx": 11800, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"f8c29e19-0490-4d6f-9b33-554ce9711e0d": {"doc_hash": "8653e2d1fc298c81aaed797872a0f16e9896dca8da06d55252fb91e144bf1eac", "ref_doc_id": "e04e8dfc-aaa2-463e-ac24-f2842160b1f6"}, "95abf655-c776-4f3a-b72b-dc1d5502abf1": {"doc_hash": "95e74d1d789d0a549ba7cf329bb08069c1f0dfe2119ef8b1ce70a47f41d90d2a", "ref_doc_id": "e04e8dfc-aaa2-463e-ac24-f2842160b1f6"}, "537be21e-397d-4d6a-8b19-c770001ca175": {"doc_hash": "983937556c3e774f12bb675ed53c73b422782716fecac25d82062182f0e667f2", "ref_doc_id": "e04e8dfc-aaa2-463e-ac24-f2842160b1f6"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"e04e8dfc-aaa2-463e-ac24-f2842160b1f6": {"node_ids": ["f8c29e19-0490-4d6f-9b33-554ce9711e0d", "95abf655-c776-4f3a-b72b-dc1d5502abf1", "537be21e-397d-4d6a-8b19-c770001ca175"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\layout\\Log_Structure_and_Presentation\\Global_Settings_for_Depth_Plots.htm"}}}}
