This feature is also used to publish the ODF into a web folder.\n\nThe ODF is divided into multiple VUF files based on chunk size (in pixels), which are compressed during the saving process and then published to a web folder. The VUF files can then be streamed in, in a sequential manner, decompressing as they do.\n\nStream Out\n\nClick File from the GEO menu bar and select Stream Out VUFs; a dialog box will appear.\n\nEnter the FULL URL for the Web folder directory or path for the File directory that you want to store the VUF files in.\n\nEnter a Chunk Size in pixels (i.e. the amount of pixels you wish to be in each separate VUF file).\n\nSelecting one of the Chunks Ordered option buttons allows you to select the sequence that the files are saved in, e.g. descending (bottom of log to top) or ascending (top of log to bottom).\n\nDefine what chunk you want to save the headers and trailers in (e.g. chunk one, two or at the end) by selecting the appropriate option button.\n\nSelect Save to publish the file, or Cancel to abort.\n\nStream In\n\nOpen GEO (or GEOView or GEOe-View) and click File from the menu bar and select Stream In VUFs.\n\nEnter the FULL URL for the Web folder directory or path for the File directory, followed by the file name of the VUF files\n\nNote. Name of first VUF file will be the ODF file name succeeded by \u2018-001.vuf\u2019\n\nSelect OK to begin streaming in, or Cancel to abort.\n\nTip. Large graphics in the headers and trailers will significantly decrease streaming speeds.\n\nThe bigger the chunk size in pixels, the longer it will take the first file to stream in, however a bigger chunk size will generate less chunks, thus total time may be slightly decreased.\n\nAs a guide we recommend a chunk size of approx 800 pixels.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2035, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"40a838c3-079c-43fe-bd46-c1db1488147e": {"doc_hash": "825a808982ff09379c18aee45c7c24c18a33e2a105411f3f2c9075a17d2d5b4b", "ref_doc_id": "14865163-3850-4190-9c9f-04c0f6f1e40a"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"14865163-3850-4190-9c9f-04c0f6f1e40a": {"node_ids": ["40a838c3-079c-43fe-bd46-c1db1488147e"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\introduction\\Sharing\\Publish_ODF_to_Web_Folder\\VUF_File_Transfe.htm"}}}}
