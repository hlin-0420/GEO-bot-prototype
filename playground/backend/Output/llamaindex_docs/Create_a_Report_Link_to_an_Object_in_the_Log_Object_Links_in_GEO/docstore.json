The Create or Modify External and Internal Links for an Object dialog box will open.\n\nCreate or modify an External Link by typing in the desired URL or using the Browse button to locate a local or network file.\n\nCreate or modify an Internal Link by selecting the corresponding header or trailer option button and selecting the appropriate specification.\n\nTip. Alternatively, clicking Links from the properties dialog box of each object also allows you to create or modify the links.\n\nRelative Paths\n\nThis option allows you to truncate any file path relative to the location of the actual log you are linking the object too. If the file path of the linked document is the same as the log then the path will be truncated to \u2018.\\Core Data.doc\u2019 for example, denoting its location as the same as the log itself.\n\nLeft clear, the file path will be displayed in UNC (Universal Naming Convention).\n\nViewing the links\n\nIf an object has an Internal or External Link, its location is displayed in a tool tip when the mouse pointer is over the object.\n\nYou can open that external link by right-clicking the object and clicking Open External Link from the menu. This should invoke your web browser for a Web URL, or an application associated with whatever the external link references (for example, a link to a file with a .doc extension would normally open MS Word, if this application is present on the viewing-user\u2019s computer or network).\n\nFor an internal link, click Go after right-clicking the object, to bring the referenced header or trailer into view.\n\nMarkers\n\nYou can select a more obvious indicator that a link exists by selecting a mark from the drop down list at the bottom of the dialog box. The adjacent drop down list the positions you can display your marker. To remove an unwanted marker, simply set the marker to the blank option at the top of the list.\n\nDelete a Link\n\nThe In Use option is automatically checked when you create a link, defining the link as active. In order to delete a link, clear this option, the link will then be deleted.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nODF viewers like GEOView and GEOe-View do not have context menus for objects (i.e. you cannot right-click the object).\n\nHowever, if an object has a link, this is displayed as a tool tip when the mouse pointer is above it, and the mouse pointer should change to the pointing-hand form, indicating the presence of the link.\n\nIn addition, double-clicking on the object will bring an Internal Link into view or invoke the appropriate action for an External Link.\n\nIf the object has both an Internal and an External Link, a context menu will display to allow selection of the appropriate link.\n\nSVG output also contains External link information and may be viewed by double clicking the object.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4649, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3df55aff-86b2-4214-875a-1dce8c5e77e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "3df55aff-86b2-4214-875a-1dce8c5e77e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\introduction\\Sharing\\Create_a_Report_Link_to_an_Object_in_the_Log\\Object_Links_in_GEO.htm"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1de46507-381e-4afd-b140-1a791765b46a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\introduction\\Sharing\\Create_a_Report_Link_to_an_Object_in_the_Log\\Object_Links_in_GEO.htm"}, "hash": "d0ca6320e399f1697b15b8b821cadf8ce24f5d8777f1e1aae711a2c4f104bc1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0882ae9d-ec72-42c6-aa27-d5b74d590268", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\introduction\\Sharing\\Create_a_Report_Link_to_an_Object_in_the_Log\\Object_Links_in_GEO.htm"}, "hash": "8bdf1cafc8c999ddb9a4225dad58b0504709782748608b8ff7630a25d4e74268", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Delete a Link\n\nThe In Use option is automatically checked when you create a link, defining the link as active.
