All mnemonics must be unique within the ODF file. The software uses the mnemonic ID to uniquely identify a mnemonic.\n\nA mnemonic consists of the following;\n\nComponent Example Mnemonic Identifier (ID) WD Description Well Depth Value 115 Units FT View in Shell No or Yes (Yes enables the mnemonic value to display when selecting the .odf file in windows explorer)\n\nAdd mnemonic to header\n\nThe following steps demonstrate how to add a Field Name mnemonic to the header. If this mnemonic is added to the header of other layouts in the odf, then any changes made to the mnemonic Value will be changed in the other layout headers also.\n\nPlease note that mnemonics can only be added to headers if your license includes GEOVectdraw.\n\nOpen the Header in GEOVectdraw.\n\nUse the Mnem Desc/Val/Unit tool to add a mnemonic. The Mnemonic (Group) Properties dialog box will open.\n\nEnter the following information;\n\nMnemonic - FN\n\nMnemonic Description - Field Name\n\nMnemonic Value - Drent\n\nNote. Leave System Variable clear\n\nSave your changes in vectdraw.\n\nOnce the header has been finalized, you will see Field Name: Drent in each ODF header:\n\nEdit mnemonic\n\nContinuing the example above, the 'Field Name' (Mnemonic Description) and 'Drent' (Mnemonic Value) can be edited in GEO using one of these two methods;\n\nEdit directly in the ODF by left clicking the mnemonic description or value in the plot header or trailer.\n\nFrom the Define Mnemonics dialog box - on the Define tab, select Mnemonics . Here, you can also define pre-set values that can be selected from a drop list in the header.\n\nNote. GEOVectDraw is not be required for these alterations. However, any changes made via these methods are only valid/happen in that particular ODF.\n\nAdd mnemonic values from Las Files : Information Blocks\n\nWhen a LAS file is loaded to the GEO Software Suite, the software reads in and stores all the available mnemonics in the Parameter Information block and the Well Information block from that particular LAS file. GEO then maintains these mnemonics on a per file basis. The data in these blocks forms the basis for the final values for each mnemonic in a particular log.\n\nIf data is loaded in a non-Las format, but you wish to export it from GEO into Las format, then mnemonics will not automatically have their information block assigned. However, this can be done manually in GEO.\n\nOn the Define tab, select Mnemonics. The Define Mnemonics will open.\n\nAll data files loaded into the ODF will be available in the File drop down list at the top. The corresponding mnemonics from those files will be listed in the box directly below in the mnemonics area.\n\nTo add a mnemonic to the plot,\n\nMulti-select by dragging the mouse over a range of entries in the mnemonics area, or hold Ctrl and click the individual mnemonics you wish to add. They should now have a blue highlight\n\nClick Add to Plot. The appropriate header will now populate with the information provided the mnemonics in the header VOB match.\n\nClick Exit to return to the plot area.\n\nIn the Plot Mnemonics section to the right of the table you will see a column labeled Information Block.\n\nEnter the letters P, W or O to stipulate which block you wish to assign the mnemonic to, Parameters, Well or Other.\n\nDo this for each mnemonic you wish to appear in the required block and click Exit.\n\nIf you now wish to export a curve as XML, the mnemonics assigned as Parameter Information will now populate in the file.\n\nSee the section on loading XML files to learn more about importing XML data.\n\nTips. Using the API recommended mnemonic (while designing the header with GEOVectDraw) will help the user to complete the header information, whenever a LAS file is loaded into the software.\n\nSelect the corresponding LAS file (from the File list box in Define Mnemonics dialog box) to determine the appropriate mnemonic values for your plot header.\n\nThe possible length of a mnemonic is 32 characters. The API standards have not changed, so most mnemonics will still be three or four characters, but you have the option of creating user defined mnemonics that are longer.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4568, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"6c3d7307-8eb2-4311-aa5b-9d4a2ce194a7": {"doc_hash": "871e77183b1e5067902067ac7a1ec982274d311bd23c225522a0d937a3503f7c", "ref_doc_id": "cdd81bab-e1eb-47f8-8ff2-2772dca92f7e"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"cdd81bab-e1eb-47f8-8ff2-2772dca92f7e": {"node_ids": ["6c3d7307-8eb2-4311-aa5b-9d4a2ce194a7"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\raw_data\\Headers_and_Trailers\\Mnemonics_for_Header_and_Trailers\\Mnemonics_in_G.htm"}}}}
