This feature is useful in fining up/down sequences in Core Log analysis but can also be used to remove poor data.\n\nOn the Curves tab, select Mouse Set Curve Data. The cursor will change\n\nOn the plot, place the cursor at the depth and value that you want the gradient to start.\n\nClick and hold to start straightening the curve. Move the cursor to the end depth and value and release. The Set Curve Values dialog box will open.\n\nThe Curve number and Mnemonic will be listed. Please check this is the curve you wish to straighten. If there are multiple curves in the same track, you may have straightened the wrong curve. If this is the case, select Cancel and read the Multiple curves on the same track information below.\n\nManually adjust the Depth required.\n\nThree types of gradient can be defined.\n\nFor a vertical gradient: Tick Single Curve Value (Vertical) and enter the Curve Value.\n\nFor a fixed step gradient: tick Specify Curve Step (instead of curve end value) and enter the Curve Value and Curve Step Value. Note. GEO Message 1957 will appear if the curve step results in the modified curve appearing outside the curve range detailing the step value range available.\n\nTo define the start and end curve value, leave the tick boxes empty and enter both Curve Values.\n\nSelect OK to save the properties and generate the modified curve.\n\nMultiple curves on the same track If there are multiple curves on the same track, there are three rules which determine which curve is used to draw the fixed gradient between two depths.\n\nThe curve which appears first in the curve order will be used, therefore if you want to straighten another curve you will have to turn the display off for all the curves appearing before in the curve order list, click here to get information on how to do this.\n\nThe last curve edited will be the default curve. Therefore, if curve B is edited and then curve A (which appears beforehand in the list) is enabled, curve B will be used for Mouse Set Curve Values, until its display is turned off.\n\nIf there are multiple curves on the same track but they occur at different depths then the first curve in the list (at that depth) will be used.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2441, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"f919b21c-e015-41be-8342-e7148363a8be": {"doc_hash": "68fb593e473aaf632333c3fc7dc7cbe64a4e076bc0fbdc488eda7aeebd32195a", "ref_doc_id": "f2b8ca1c-a4ac-4412-903d-4d3e1683f197"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"f2b8ca1c-a4ac-4412-903d-4d3e1683f197": {"node_ids": ["f919b21c-e015-41be-8342-e7148363a8be"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\processed_data\\Create_Curve_Data\\Mouse_Set_Curve_Data.htm"}}}}
