Such data can often be obtained from the vendor of survey data (nowadays, often the MWD company). Then the software needs to be told which data is going to be used for MD-TVD calculation and determine which depth system is going to be displayed.\n\nInform the software which data is going to be used for MD-TVD calculation\n\nFirst, load the MD (Measured Depth) versus TVD (True Vertical Depth) curve data. Click here for instructions on loading curve data.\n\nOn the Depth tab in the Conversion group, select TVD from the Curve drop list.\n\nCheck the Use Data for TVD Conversion box.\n\nIf a subsea correction needs to be applied, check TVDSS Correction and enter the value in the TVDSS Correction text box. To present it as a negative value, tick TVDSS as Negative.\n\nWhich depth system will display on the Plot?\n\nOn the Edit tab, click Track Settings to open the Track Settings dialog box.\n\nOpen the Legend and Index tab.\n\nSelect the Depth track.\n\nIn the Primary and Alternative Index System Settings, open the Display list and choose the depth system you wish to present. Note. Please remember that the Primary and alternative depth system refer to the MD and TVD. Either MD or TVD can be the Primary or the alternative - it is defined in global settings and expanded on below.\n\nThe position of the primary depth system can be justified by selecting Centre, Left or Right justify from the Primary Justification box\n\nDepth ticks can be placed for primary and/or alternate, by selecting the corresponding depths in the Ticks drop list.\n\nThe font type, style, size and color of the depth value of each depth system legend, can be selected by clicking Font in the Primary and Alternate Index Settings.\n\nClick OK to close the Track Settings dialog box.\n\nTo specify which depths are primary or alternative, click Global Settings on the Edit tab. The Global Settings dialog box will open.\n\nTo define MD as the primary depth, select the MD button in the Primary Depth System section. TVD will be automatically selected as the Alternate Depth System. In this case, if Primary & Alternate is selected at the Display box of the Track Settings dialog box, both MD and TVD will be displayed.\n\nTo compress the whole log into TVD select TVD as your Primary Depth System in Global Settings. Then, in the Track Settings open the Legends and Depths tab anbd select Primary Only in the Display list.\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2869, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"ee8d24ca-2ee5-4cb0-89a9-3456e10c6156": {"doc_hash": "debe598e992b22293fecb03be60c0a9ff1ea66ab8a6d361c76d9c678073f0d35", "ref_doc_id": "5250129b-c1be-4e14-a72d-e76dde9317b0"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"5250129b-c1be-4e14-a72d-e76dde9317b0": {"node_ids": ["ee8d24ca-2ee5-4cb0-89a9-3456e10c6156"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\raw_data\\TVD\\Presenting_TVD.htm"}}}}
