There are two ways to place the OUF as an e-mail attachment:\n\nBy attaching the OUF files manually within your e-mail software itself.\n\nUsing Send OUF Updates via Mail (from the GEO menu) feature in GEO.\n\nIf the Send OUF Updates via Mail feature is utilized, you do not need to click the Save OUF Updates to save the sequential OUF. Pointing at Send OUF Updates via Mail and clicking the Updates option automatically saves the next sequential OUF file.\n\nFor first time usage, you need to go through the following procedure to set it up:\n\nOn the GEO meny, select Send OUF Updates via Mail to open the Choose Profile dialog box. It allows you to select the information service by which the OUF file will be mailed. You can set up your choice of information service using the Windows Messaging Set-Up Wizard. Once selected, this invokes your installed e-mail software (for example MS Outlook) and opens the Message dialog box.\n\nThe Message dialog box consists of two tabs - Message and Options.\n\nThe Message tab allows you to enter the address (or addresses) of the OUF recipient(s). You can enter any desired text here, which is then mailed along with the OUF file.\n\nThe Options tab allows you to set several options relating to the conditions under which the mail is sent. The Importance Level, Delivery Options and Tracking Options can all be set from this tab.\n\nNext time you click Send OUF Updates via Mail from the GEO menu, the corresponding OUF will be saved and it will open your e-mail software with the OUF automatically created as the attachment. You can type the message as normal prior to sending this e-mail.\n\nIn the event that you not complete the Send OUF via Mail sequence and quit partially through the steps (e.g. you do not really send the e-mail), GEO will inform you that the OUF file has already been saved (specifying the file path) and that the particular OUF must be sent manually (as an e-mail attachment, for example).\n\nIf you click Send Range of OUF Updates via Mail, a Re-Save range of updates dialog box opens. Click the row which details the OUF sequence number to be saved over. Click Save and this will create an underscore OUF number that can be sent as an e-mail attachment.\n\n\u21b5\n\nBack Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2472, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"cd63de52-8c30-4bac-8f00-06b404add5d1": {"doc_hash": "a2e410d39148a5472df9849ebcc37d10e1bf07f33b4d11930284eec602be01cb", "ref_doc_id": "15adc466-650a-457e-8fab-d76eb140c1d3"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"15adc466-650a-457e-8fab-d76eb140c1d3": {"node_ids": ["cd63de52-8c30-4bac-8f00-06b404add5d1"], "metadata": {"path": "C:\\Users\\haoch\\Desktop\\GEO-bot-prototype\\Data\\html_files\\introduction\\Sharing\\ODF_Update_File_(OUF))\\Send_OUF_as_mail_attachment.htm"}}}}
