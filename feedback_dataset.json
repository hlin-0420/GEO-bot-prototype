    "response": "An ODT (OpenDocument Template) is a file format that can be used to create templates for documents. It contains library information, view file contents, ini file settings, and other data that can be used to customize the appearance and behavior of a document. An ODT file can be created from an existing ODF (OpenDocument Format) file using a wizard or by manually editing the file. Once created, an ODT file can be distributed to other users and used as a starting point for creating new documents.",
