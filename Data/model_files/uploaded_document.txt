Use panning to see another part of a page that has scroll bars. For example, you can pan to see part of a long document or spreadsheet that doesn't appear in the window.

Simply touch and drag the page with two fingers.

Press and hold on the object you would like to move, drag it to it's new location and then lift your finger.

Press and holddoes the same thing as right-clicking an item.

To perform the action, touch the screen where you want to right-click, hold until a complete circle appears, and then lift your finger. The shortcut menu appears after you lift your finger.

Use zooming to make an item on the screen larger or smaller. Zooming in shows a smaller area in more detail; zooming out shows a larger area.

To zoom out, touch two points on the item, and then move your fingers toward each other, as if you're pinching them together. To zoom in, touch two points on the item, and then move your fingers away from each other, as if you're stretching them apart.
