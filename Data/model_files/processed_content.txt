Introduction to GEO GEO is an integrated a PC-based integrated well log authoring, analysis and reporting system which has been developed for petroleum geologists, geoscientists and engineers.
Building upon concepts that the software should be easy to learn, simple and intuitive to use, and invoking our 'you should only have to do it once' method of working, Geologix has developed and enhanced the GEO suite of applications with continuous input from our users.
The GEO applications provide flexible integrated and tailored solutions for managing both well-site and laboratory derived data, by combining a powerful yet extremely compact database, with a user-friendly graphical interface.
You can manipulate curve data, lithology blocks, modifiers, symbols and text with the mouse and keyboard, to log information into the database.
Is it a versatile software that may be used to create an infinite variety of user-defined plot presentations.
Some examples are well proposal charts, lithology logs, composite logs, well summary logs, drilling time charts, gas analysis, quick-look water saturation and pore pressure charts plots.
Content can be fully customized to suit individual or corporate preferences.
Lithology patterns, modifiers, symbols, headers and trailers can all be designed or modified by you to match existing or standard log requirements.

Your software level and version are written at the top at the GEO -About box that is invoked.
Apart from these software details, this box also provides the following information: Additional modules, if any ODF (Database ) version Licence name and licence number Type of dongle ( CodeMeter/Flexnet )
Note that it is the security-device (dongle) provided with your software that determines the level of your software (i. e. GEO or GEO Lite ), any supplied additional modules, and thus the accessible features.
The software version however is determined by the software installed from CD-ROM (or web-downloaded update).
You can therefore upgrade the level of your installation easily at any time (e. g. from GEO Lite to GEO ) by simply substituting a new dongle supplied by Geologix Limited.
You don’t need to re-install the application, except when upgrading from GEO Logger.

• Additional modules, if any
• ODF (Database) version
• Licence name and licence number

RUS Rental Dongle Guide RUS Rental Dongle Guide The RUS ( Remote Update Service )
Dongle is specially configured to be used for rented licenses of our applications.
This new style of renting gives greater flexibility for rental terms and also increased access to updates.
The clock on your machine now governs your rental periods.
A license will run from one set date and time to another set date and time.
The period between these two dates will be when you can access your GEO Software Suite application.
Should you require more time on the current rental or foresee a period where you may require the GEO Software Suite again, a new license file can be sent via e-mail to update your dongles validity.
The update file that is used to update the validity of your CodeMeter RUS license requires a. WibuCmRaU file.
The update file is used to update the validity of your RUS dongle.
WibuCmRaU file contains the information pertaining to the rental period.
These files can be sent directly via e-mail and can instantly be applied to gain access to GEO Software Suite applications.
Updating a License/License Expiry This can be done in two ways depending on the current status of the license in the RUS dongle.
An extension can also be applied after the license has expired, this is detailed below.
If a rental period has expired.
Attempting to run the application will invoke a dialog allowing you to browse to and apply a new license file (.
GEO will automatically run once the new license has been applied.
If you do not have a license file and wish to request one, please follow the procedure below.
Requesting a Rental Update If you are presented with a dialog box when accessing GEO you license has either expired or close to expiring.
Choose the appropriate option from the warning dialog.
The Request License Renewal E-mail will invoke.
You will see that some information is already pre-filled for you.
All you have to do is supply the dates of your new rental period and fill in your personal/company (license) details.
On receipt of your request we shall provide a response e-mail notifying you that we are dealing with your request.
Opening/Applying a License Update File Locate your.
WibuCmRaU file Click on it so it appears in the File Name section.
Click OK to apply the new license information.
New license Period activated indication will appear.
Should you need to change your computers clock Important.
Usage Information is stored in the RUS dongle using your computers clock.
If changing your machine time is required i. e. you are changing time zones, it is recommended that you use the Time Zones feature accessible through the Windows Ô clock, rather than changing your time manually.
Changing the clock manually will disrupt the time configuration and you may risk losing time on your rental - or worse rendering your licence completely inaccessible.

• Locate your .WibuCmRaU file
• Click on it so it appears in the File Name section.
• Click OK to apply the new license information.
• New license Period activated indication will appear.

Event Log ↵ Event Log The Event log records important episodes in the life of an ODF file.
File saving, curve editing and loading episodes are all recorded in the View Event Log in Descending Ch ronological order dialog box.
This can be invoked by selecting View Event Log from the GEO tab.
Events are listed in a chronological order, applying a date and time stamp for each.
The following are included in the event log: ODF file load Save OUF creation Log on as a new user name Depth shift the curves Note.
A new save event would not be created every time you save the ODF file.
If one user saved a file multiple times in one day, only one save event would be recorded.
The date and time field would simply update and record the most recent time saved.
The next day however, the first save would invoke a new file save event.
If multiple users saved files multiple times in one day, a save event would be recorded for each user detailing the most recent time saved.
The event log details the following information.
Start and end data depth (relating to the data load event).
The name of the User who logged on to the software at the time of the ‘event’.
Date and time of the ‘event’.
The Error column that details any GEO error ‘message number’ should an error occur during a file load or save episode.
If no error occurs this value will show zero.
This information depends on the ‘event’.
If it were a file load episode for example, the description would detail the ‘Number of data columns that were loaded’, ‘File path’, ‘File name’, ‘ GEO license number’ and whether the curves were appended.
Relating to a file save, the description will detail the directory saved to and the file name.
Click Print to print the event log using the printer that you have setup through the Print Setup.
The user can resize this dialog box, as well as the widths of the data-table columns.
The next time this dialog box is invoked, it will use the last-sized width (also the data-table columns).

Login for Access to Document ↵ Login for Access to Document In order to preserve secrecy on any work that you do within GEO, it is possible for you to set password protection on your files.
There are three levels of protection you can apply to a document: Update, View / Print and Export.
When attempting to access a document that is password protected you will be faced with a drop down option box and a text box.
Select File, then Open/Import to locate the desired document.
Click on the small arrow at the end of the drop down option box.
Select Update, View / Print or Export.
In the box below type in the password for the appropriate selection.
Clicking Cancel will result in the appearance of a warning message and termination of the GEO program.
Once access is granted you may perform the relevant modifications or actions dependent on the access level you have reached.
Any option that is ‘grayed’ out will not be available on the current level of access.
Passwords are not case sensitive.

• Select File , then Open/Import to locate the desired document.

===== FILE: c:\Users\HaochengLin\Documents\GitHub\GEO-bot-prototype\Data\html_files\introduction\Sharing\Protecting_your_ODF_File.htm =====

Protecting your ODF File ↵ Protecting your ODF File ODF files can be password protected should the content of the file be of a confidential nature, and/or you want to prevent certain recipients of the file from modifying or updating its content.
Use the following procedure to password your file.
On the Define tab, select Password s.
The Specify Access for Document will open.
From the Select Desired Access list, select the Update access level.
In the Enter Password for Acc ess, type the chosen password.
Re-confirm the password in the Re-enter Password box.
The password is not case sensitive and its maximum length is 15 characters.
Repeat this process for the View / Print and Export access level listed in the Select desired Access box.
Remember to keep a record of your chosen password(s) in a secure place, as once password protected you will not be able to open the ODF, or change/remove password protection without the correct Update level password.
Next time the ODF file is saved, the password protection will be implemented at the chosen access level.
Each time the ODF file is opened thereafter, the appropriate password must be entered for the required access level.
You cannot apply a password for View / Print access, without first applying a password for Update access.
Password protection can be removed/changed only by opening the ODF with the Update access level password, and then deleting the entries in the password fields.
You must delete the View / Print access password first, before attempting to remove the password for Update access.
If a password for Update access has been applied to an ODF, you basically send it as a ‘Read-Only’ file to another party (or simply like a picture).
The other party will not have any access to the data that builds this ODF, unless they are separately provided with the appropriate password.

• On the Define tab, select Passwords . The Specify Access for Document will open.

Object Links in GEO Object Links in GEO You can provide additional information for log elements (such as lithology units, modifiers, symbols, free format text and track text blocks) by linking those objects, at any instance within the log, with another file (e. g. a morning-report that is written in MS Word Ô format).
When viewing the log ( ODF ) within a web browser (such as Internet Explorer Ô ), the link feature will allow the user to click an object and read any further information that is linked to it.
This allows you to create ‘hyperlinks’ as they are widely deployed throughout the internet or on intranets, without any prior knowledge of the web-based Hyper-Text Markup Language
In GEO, an object can have an External Link, an Internal Link, or both.
External Links Typically an External Link could point to a Universal Resource Locator [URL] (on the Internet or Intranet) or Network location that provides more information about one of the above objects.
This information is not stored in the document, only a link to the information is stored.
The Link could point to a Web page, a picture or other document.
For example a Core symbol could point to a URL that has an actual picture of the core section stored on the Intranet or Internet.
This allows information to be stored at the most appropriate location, where it can be kept up-to-date and easily viewed from the Link in your document.
Internal Links An Internal Link can be used to associate a Header or Trailer specifications with a lithology, symbol or free format text occurrence.
Learn how to add a header or trailer to your log.
Create or Modify links Right-click the object on the log that you want to link to another report (or photograph, etc.).
Click Create/ Modify Link from the menu.
The Create or Modify Ext ernal and Internal Links for an Object dialog box will open.
Create or modify an External Link by typing in the desired URL or using the Browse button to locate a local or network file.
Create or modify an Internal Link by selecting the corresponding header or trailer option button and selecting the appropriate specification.
Alternatively, clicking Links from the properties dialog box of each object also allows you to create or modify the links.
This option allows you to truncate any file path relative to the location of the actual log you are linking the object too.
If the file path of the linked document is the same as the log then the path will be truncated to ‘.\ Core Data.
doc’ for example, denoting its location as the same as the log itself.
Left clear, the file path will be displayed in UNC ( Universal Naming Convention ).
Viewing the links If an object has an Internal or External Link, its location is displayed in a tool tip when the mouse pointer is over the object.
You can open that external link by right-clicking the object and clicking Open External Link from the menu.
This should invoke your web browser for a Web URL, or an application associated with whatever the external link references (for example, a link to a file with a. doc extension would normally open MS Word Ô, if this application is present on the viewing-user’s computer or network).
For an internal link, click Go after right-clicking the object, to bring the referenced header or trailer into view.
Markers You can select a more obvious indicator that a link exists by selecting a mark from the drop down list at the bottom of the dialog box.
The adjacent drop down list the positions you can display your marker.
To remove an unwanted marker, simply set the marker to the blank option at the top of the list.
The In Use option is automatically checked when you create a link, defining the link as active.
In order to delete a link, clear this option, the link will then be deleted.
Additional Information ODF viewers like GEO View and GEO e-View do not have context menus for objects (i. e. you cannot right-click the object).
However, if an object has a link, this is displayed as a tool tip when the mouse pointer is above it, and the mouse pointer should change to the pointing-hand form, indicating the presence of the link.
In addition, double-clicking on the object will bring an Internal Link into view or invoke the appropriate action for an External Link.
If the object has both an Internal and an External Link, a context menu will display to allow selection of the appropriate link.
SVG output also contains External link information and may be viewed by double clicking the object.
If an object has a link, when the mouse pointer is brought over the object in the SVG display, the mouse pointer should also change to a hand pointer and display link information in the status bar of the Web browser.
Learn how to export the plot to SVG format.

Export All Other Data (except curve data)
Export All Other Data (except curve data)
Export All Other Data (except curve data)
Some of the information used to create a composite log may need to be cataloged in other systems such as the corporate geological database.
Therefore, there should be a means to export data captured by GEO (and encapsulated in the ODF ) to the other system.
There are a couple of ways to do this.
To export all other data, except for the curve data, using the Export All Information feature.
To export the curve data to LAS, Text-tab delimited or Comma-tab delimited format, please use the Export Curve Data feature Export All Information
This feature allows you to select specific ODF components (or objects) to be exported from GEO, since not all objects in an ODF may need to be exported.
For example, although a box around text is a symbol, it has no relevance to geology.
Similarly, in a long sequence the age-dating column may have the word JURASSIC repeated several times.
Only one of the text blocks signifies the correct interval.
This dialog box shows total number of the items in an ODF file and allows you to choose what to be exported from GEO.
Use the following procedure to export the data from GEO through an intermediary text-form file: Open the ODF containing the data to be exported.
On the Export tab select All Info.
The Select Items to Export will open.
Objects with the check box selected will be exported.
If you do not want to export an object, clear the check box.
At each object, you will see the total number of that item in the ODF and the number of selected elements to be exported.
By default, all total numbers will be exported.
Clicking Select at each item brings up the items’ list, allowing you to select a particular item of that object to be exported.
The total number of the selected items of each object will be written under the Selected column.
The Export As dialog box will open.
Enter a File name and select a folder to save to.
Click Save to start exporting the selected objects from GEO.
The ‘logical block’ of the text ( TXT ) file as the Export All Info result is shown below.
A semicolon (";") as the first token in a line denotes a comment-line, which has been inserted only for the purpose of readability.
Each block begins with a BEGIN keyword, followed by the type of the block; a block always ends with an END keyword.
The Global block is always the first block in the file.
The depth values will always be represented in the fixed-point notation.
The mnemonic-name will always be four characters long.
The symbol-type, modifier-type and litho-type will be the (up to) eight-character names as they appear in GEO.
The free-format text and track text field will consist of a text-length field followed by a ":" character and then the text-value.
A single <CR> character denotes a new-line.

Export GEO Plot as Image Export GEO Plot as Image There are multiple options for the conversion of your plot into an image format.
Metafiles are essentially a way of intelligently storing pictorial information and provide a useful means of transferring plots to other applications.
Their main advantage is that in general, they are far less prone to distortion when scaled than bitmaps.
This is because in a metafile, shapes can be defined as a mathematical formula rather than as a conglomeration of dots.
The other advantage is that a metafile usually requires less disk space than a corresponding bitmap.
You can export the complete plot, or any section of it, to the following formats.
CGM - Computer Graphics Metafiles (Binary format) WMF - Standard Windows Metafile Placeable WMF WMF - Metafile Picture to Clipboard EMF - Enhanced Metafile EMF - Enhanced Metafile using Screen Settings EMF - Enhanced Metafile to clipboard TIFF - Tagged Image Format SVG - Scaleable Vector Graphics Export Plot as an Image On the Export tab, select Export As.

The default path for these exported files depends on the type of metafile output selected.
The default path for WMF and CGM are defined at the File Locations tab in the Registry Editor dialog box (opened by selecting Edit GEO Settings from the Edit tab) and can be changed, as required.
Prior to exporting to a metafile, select a suitable printer device from the print setup dialog box.
GEO will use the device driver to obtain the horizontal resolution (pixels per inch), vertical resolution (pixels per inch), page size (pixels) and text formatting information.
We recommend you install a suitable printer driver for just this purpose, as our experience has shown that certain printer-drivers are poor at creating metafiles.
We recommend use of the printer-driver for the EPSON STYLUS 1520 COLOR Ô printer for optimum metafile creation.

Export GEO Plot to CGM Export GEO Plot to CGM The CGM (Computer Graphic Metafile) format can be used to transfer a plot to a large plotter (e. g. HP DesignJet Ô ) through CGM interpreter software (such as Zeh Graphics Ô or SDI Ô software).
One reason for doing so is to circumvent the length limitation (109 inches) of certain printer-drivers operating under Windows Ô.
This limitation does not of course arise when plotting under the UNIX platform.
GEO can export to CGM files with either 16 or 32-bit precision.
The 16-bit CGM complies with ISO-8362 binary specifications and may not be able to cope with very long plots.
The 32-bit CGM, on the other hand, is equipped to handle any length of plot and is compatible with PIP (Petroleum Information Profile).
Export Plot to CGM On the Edit tab, select Headers and Trailers.
T he Plot Header and Trailer Specifications dialog box will open.
If a trailer component such as a spreadsheet was loaded with the OLE object check box selected, you can remove the OLE object with the following simple procedure.
Double-click that spreadsheet in the trailer in GEO to open it in the native application (perhaps MS Excel Ô ).
Copy it to the clipboard and load it back at the Plot Header and Trailer Specifications dialog box, with the same name, but this time ensure the OLE object check box is clear (no tick).

Since the SVG file uses a clear text representation to describe graphical information, the size of the generated file may be large depending on the length and density of graphical information present in your section of displayed log.
In addition to the graphical output, SVG hotspots are generated for items that have links in the document.
If you view the generated SVG file in a browser (such as Internet Explorer Ô ), the items with links (e. g. a core symbol) will have a hotspot.
When your mouse is over such an item in your web browser, the mouse pointer will change to a hand and double-clicking should take you to the linked item.

This file can then be viewed within many third party graphics applications.
The TIFF feature can be used to export the plot as a whole, however for large plots, in both width and length there are some associated limits to be aware of.
There are two controls for exporting to TIFF format - DPI and Page Height.
Both of these options can be edited on the Edit tab in Edit GEO Settings ( General tab).
DPI DPI or Dots per Inch, relates to the resolution and quality of the output.
The higher the DPI the better quality the image will be.
When an ODF is viewed on screen at 100% please bear in mind that this will be approximately 96dpi, thus increasing the DPI for TIFF export will also serve to increase the respective size of the image by that factor.
The page height relates to the maximum length in pixels of your TIFF page.
If your log exceeds 2048 pixels wide then your max page height will be 32000 pixels If your log is less than 2048 pixels wide then your max page height will be 64000 pixels Therefore if your log is longer than 64/32k pixels then you will output a multi-page TIFF file.

Many applications may run out of memory when handling very complex pictures as created by GEO.

Concept of ODF Update File ( OUF ) Concept of ODF Update File ( OUF ) ↵ ↵
Concept of ODF Update File ( OUF )
The ODF Update File or OUF, which was introduced with version 4 of GEO Software, enables you to send daily updates with a high level of security, very cost effectively.
The prime purposes are: Adding security when e-mailing files: This is because the OUF files must be loaded sequentially.
Reducing the size, and therefore cost, of e-mailing daily updates over expensive satellite links.
The OUF file only carries ‘Update’ information; as a result the size of the files is reduced substantially.
While an ODF is being created at the wellsite, the size and complexity of the file increases throughout the duration of the well, as progressively more data is added to it.
The security of mailing the file becomes increasingly important, as do the actual costs involved.
In the scenario where a wellsite user e-mails files to an operations base, the sending of the entire ODF on a daily basis can become inefficient.
This is especially true when the recipient of the ODF is only concerned with the updates.
In the OUF model, the Wellsite user creates and maintains a Parent ODF.
From this sequential OUF files are saved.
These files are then mailed to the operations base and loaded to build an identical Child ODF.
The OUF files must be loaded in the correct sequence to successfully build the Child ODF.
The scenario below attempts to show the best practice on how this OUF model may be conducted.
At the Wellsite The first time the ODF is saved, you simply select Save
As from the GEO menu and supply a file name as normal.
When the first transfer of data from the wellsite to operations base is required, you would simply select Save OUF Updates from the GEO menu (or Send OUF Update Via Mail if you are going to send the file directly through an e-mail facility already present and set up in your PC – requires internet connection).
GEO takes the file name supplied and creates the first OUF file.
You would then e-mail, disk-fax or modem transfer the ‘WellX- 001.
ouf ’ to the operations base, instead of the WellX. odf.
Because of its in-built compressibility, the resultant OUF file will always be smaller than the Parent ODF, although for the very first transmission, there probably will not be such a marked difference in file sizes as is noticeable with the subsequent OUF s. Between transfers, the wellsite user can of course keep the Parent ODF up-to-date and saved on the local drive by using the normal Save procedure from the GEO menu.
For the next transfer, you would again select Save OUF Updates or Send OUF Update Via Mail.
GEO will then save this update as an OUF, called WellX-002.
ouf will simultaneously save the WellX. odf to the same point.
If you select Save As instead of Save OUF Updates it would result in a GEO warning message (840) advising you that saving the ODF to another name would break the connection between this ODF and all subsequent OUF s’.
Hence, say if the ODF was saved under a different name e. g. WellZ. odf.
The next time you go to Save OUF Updates the OUF would revert to WellZ- 001.
ouf because of the name change.
All the information loaded would then be encapsulated in this new OUF under the newly named ODF.
At the Operations Base You have two options for loading the OUF file.
Double-clicking on the OUF e-mail attachment.
This would launch GEO and load the OUF file automatically.
Detaching the e-mail attachment and selecting Load OUF Updates from the GEO menu After loading the 001.
ouf, the file must be saved as an ODF.
You can give a file name as appropriate.
The ODF created is often called the ‘Child’ ODF.
Each time an OUF is received and loaded, the ODF is saved prior to loading subsequent OUF s.
This ensures the child ODF is at the correct stage to load the next OUF in sequence.
The OUF s must be loaded in sequence.
If the wellsite user accidentally sends 004.
ouf without previously sending 003.
ouf the operations base user cannot load the file.
This is an important security element of the OUF file.
Please note, that OUF files may be opened and viewed within the full viewer application, GEO View.
OUF files cannot be opened directly using the free viewer, GEO e-View.
Files must first be consolidated within an ODF file (using GEO or GEO View).
After the ODF has been e-View enabled (using GEO ), it may only then be freely shared with users of the GEO e-View application.
In addition to the GEO Plus application, OUF files may be opened and viewed within the full viewer application, GEO View.
OUF files cannot be opened directly using the free viewer, GEO e-View.
Files must first be consolidated within an ODF file (using GEO or GEO View ).
After the ODF has been e-View enabled (using GEO ), it may only then be freely shared with users of the GEO e-View application.
What happens if the OUF connection is broken?
Any amendments made in the PARENT ODF, and the OUF subsequently created, will over-ride changes made in the Child ODF.
The Replication Information dialog box serves to advise the operations base user, if an amendment made in the Child ODF, has also been changed in the OUF they are loading.
This is the only scenario where a Replication Information dialog box is invoked detailing a Replication Conflict.
Example: The operations base user loads an OUF.
They then move a casing shoe symbol from 4000ft to 4500ft, and save the child ODF.
The next OUF received includes the same casing shoe having been moved in the PARENT ODF from 4000ft to 4250ft.
When the operations base user loads this OUF they will first see a Replication Information dialog box.
This advises the operations base user that a change made to the child ODF has also been changed in the parent ODF.
Exiting the dialog box will over-write the change made by the operations user in the child ODF.
After loading this OUF the casing shoe will be moved to 4250ft.
GEO takes the OUF to be loaded and checks the contents of this OUF against the contents of the child ODF.
In the above example, the Replication Information dialog box would not have been produced if the symbol had not been moved in the PARENT ODF.
The child ODF can be altered any number of times without invoking the ‘Replication Conflict’, as long as an alteration using the same log object has not been implemented in the parent ODF.
Further Example: A sandstone block has two pyritic modifiers at 3000ft. GEO assigns these modifiers their own unique id numbers (e. g. 20 & 21).
The child ODF is altered, by shifting modifier 20 to 2995ft and then saved.
The PARENT ODF is altered, by shifting modifier 21 to 3005ft.
The next sequential OUF is then saved.
When this OUF is loaded into the child ODF, a Replication Information dialog box will not open.
If however, in a later OUF, modifier 20 is shifted from 3000ft to 3005ft, upon loading this OUF a Replication Information dialog box is opened.
This is because the OUF records the shift from 3000ft to 3005ft in the parent ODF.
When scanning the child ODF, GEO by default, assumes the modifier to be positioned at 3000ft but upon loading the OUF scans and records the same modifier (20), positioned at 2995ft.
This ‘deviation’ invokes the Replication Information dialog box.

OUF Auto merge ↵ OUF Auto merge The Auto merge OUF feature allows users to load OUF files received (from wellsite or well partner) at a user-defined frequency (or time interval).
This frequency can be set by entering the appropriate value (in minutes) at A uto Merge OUF s every box at the Other tab of Global Settings dialog box (on the Edit tab).
The feature is disabled by default as the frequency is set at 0 (zero) minutes.
To enable the feature, simply specify the frequency at which the application should ‘check’ for new OUF files to auto-merge into the child ODF.
An OUF Load directory must be specified from the File Locations tab of the Registry Editor dialog box.
This dialog box can be launched from GEO by selecting Edit GEO Settings from the Edit tab.
At the user-defined frequency specified, the application reverts to the location specified for the OUF Load Directory to check for the new OUF files.
The procedure is as follows: Load the first OUF file by clicking Load OUF Updates from the GEO menu.
Once the first OUF has been loaded, you must save it as an ODF file.
From this point, the software will revert to the folder location specified, at the user-defined frequency, to check for and load the next sequential OUF file(s).
If the next expected file is present in the OUF Load folder, and the relevant ODF file open, the software will confirm whether you wish to load that sequential OUF.
If multiple sequential OUF files are encountered, these can be loaded in turn.
If the frequency of transmission of OUF files from the wellsite is increased, if only to match the realistic acquisition of data, then this feature may be deployed to provide an often operationally satisfactory ‘near-real time’ data stream to the operations base.

• Load the first OUF file by clicking Load OUF Updates from the GEO menu.
• Once the first OUF has been loaded, you must save it as an ODF file.

OUF Resave Feature ↵ OUF
Resave Feature What happens if somehow the chain of OUF file is broken (for instance, lost during sending) and cannot be re-sent?
There is an OUF re-save feature that enables the parent OUF user to re-save over previously saved OUF s. Example: The wellsite user saves 007.
ouf after loading new data.
This data happens to be corrupt and upon mailing, the recipient experiences difficulty loading the OUF.
When the 007 is re-sent, the same problem occurs again so the well site user becomes aware of the problem.
The corrupt data is stripped from the ODF, and new data is reloaded.
You select Save OUF Updates from the GEO menu and GEO saves the OUF as 008.
This OUF cannot be loaded by the user in the operation base, since the last OUF loaded successfully was 006 and the OUF s must be loaded in sequence.
The wellsite user can click Resave Range of OUF Updates from the GEO menu and select the 007.
ouf from the list in the Description column of the dialog box.
Clicking Save will create a 007_009.
The 007_ portion of this filename is created because the operations user must have a 007.
ouf to maintain the sequence.
The _009 portion is created because the wellsite user created a 008.
This must now be by-passed since the 008.
ouf required the original 007.
The next OUF created by the wellsite user will be 010.
The operations user will be able to load this 010.
ouf because the last OUF loaded was the 007_009.
ouf and the _009 portion of this OUF maintains the sequence.
If an OUF sequence is ever broken, for any reasons, the Resave Range of OUF Updates option from the GEO menu can be utilized to successfully re-establish the link.
If the recipient user accidentally deleted the child ODF and the constituent OUF s, the link could always be re-established as long as the parent ODF exists.
In an extreme scenario, the wellsite user, after saving 1000 OUF s could click Re-Save Range of OUF Updates and select number 001.
ouf from the dialog box list.
GEO would then create a 001_1001.
ouf, which would include every well data amendment and addition in those 1000 OUF s. This could be e-mailed to the operations base user, loaded, and saved as a new child ODF.
The next OUF saved by the wellsite user will be 1002.
The operations base user could then load this OUF without any problem.

Send OUF as mail attachment ↵ Send OUF as Mail Attachment
In most cases, the OUF will be sent from one place to another as an e-mail attachment.
There are two ways to place the OUF as an e-mail attachment:
By attaching the OUF files manually within your e-mail software itself.
Using Send OUF Updates via Mail (from the GEO menu) feature in GEO.
If the Send OUF Updates via Mail feature is utilized, you do not need to click the Save OUF Updates to save the sequential OUF.
Pointing at Send OUF Updates via Mail and clicking the Updates option automatically saves the next sequential OUF file.
For first time usage, you need to go through the following procedure to set it up: On the GEO meny, select Send OUF Updates via Mail to open the Choose Profile dialog box.
It allows you to select the information service by which the OUF file will be mailed.
You can set up your choice of information service using the Windows Messaging Set-Up Wizard.
Once selected, this invokes your installed e-mail software (for example MS Outlook) and opens the Message dialog box.
The Message dialog box consists of two tabs - Message and Options.
The Message tab allows you to enter the address (or addresses) of the OUF recipient(s).
You can enter any desired text here, which is then mailed along with the OUF file.
The Options tab allows you to set several options relating to the conditions under which the mail is sent.
The Importance Level, Delivery Options and Tracking Options can all be set from this tab.
Next time you click Send OUF Updates via Mail from the GEO menu, the corresponding OUF will be saved and it will open your e-mail software with the OUF automatically created as the attachment.
You can type the message as normal prior to sending this e-mail.
In the event that you not complete the Send OUF via Mail sequence and quit partially through the steps (e. g. you do not really send the e-mail), GEO will inform you that the OUF file has already been saved (specifying the file path) and that the particular OUF must be sent manually (as an e-mail attachment, for example).
If you click Send Range of OUF Updates via Mail, a Re-Save range of updates dialog box opens.
Click the row which details the OUF sequence number to be saved over.
Click Save and this will create an underscore OUF number that can be sent as an e-mail attachment.

• By attaching the OUF files manually within your e-mail software itself.

VUF File Transfer VUF File Transfer With the VUF feature it is possible to transfer ODF files quickly, efficiently and in real time between remote locations via an Internet connection.
This feature is also used to publish the ODF into a web folder.
The ODF is divided into multiple VUF files based on chunk size (in pixels), which are compressed during the saving process and then published to a web folder.
The VUF files can then be streamed in, in a sequential manner, decompressing as they do.
Stream Out Click File from the GEO menu bar and select Stream Out VUF s; a dialog box will appear.
Enter the FULL URL for the Web folder directory or path for the File directory that you want to store the VUF files in.
Enter a Chunk Size in pixels (i. e. the amount of pixels you wish to be in each separate VUF file).
Selecting one of the Chunks Ordered option buttons allows you to select the sequence that the files are saved in, e. g. descending (bottom of log to top) or ascending (top of log to bottom).
Define what chunk you want to save the headers and trailers in (e. g. chunk one, two or at the end) by selecting the appropriate option button.
Select Save to publish the file, or Cancel to abort.
Stream In Open GEO (or GEO View or GEO e-View ) and click File from the menu bar and select Stream In VUF s. Enter the FULL URL for the Web folder directory or path for the File directory, followed by the file name of the VUF files Note.
Name of first VUF file will be the ODF file name succeeded by ‘-001. vuf’ Select OK to begin streaming in, or Cancel to abort.
Large graphics in the headers and trailers will significantly decrease streaming speeds.
The bigger the chunk size in pixels, the longer it will take the first file to stream in, however a bigger chunk size will generate less chunks, thus total time may be slightly decreased.
As a guide we recommend a chunk size of approx 800 pixels.

If an ODF file, has a data range of 0-10000ft, but only a specific depth range, 7000-8000ft is of interest, sending an ODF with the remaining 9000ft of data is unnecessary and inefficient.
Instead, an OIF file containing the 7000-8000ft of data can be saved, creating a much smaller file.
To save an OIF File Display the depth range required.
On the Depth tab, enter the From and To index range i. e. 7000-8000.

ODF Template File ( ODT ) ODF Template File ( ODT ) ODF Template File ( ODT )
A template ( ODT ) can be created from fresh or from an existing ODF file.
This means once a preferred format has been created it can be saved as a template and utilized thereafter.
Unlike a View file (a file with VEW extension), which only saves the track layout, the template function saves all the ODF constituents in a template format.
This ensures that preferred components, such as library files (i. e. lithology, headers with included location maps, symbols, modifiers) are incorporated into the template.
Any plot objects in the ODF will also be incorporated into the template saved.
Once an ODT file has been created, it may be distributed to other users.
The ODT file is a powerful tool when a final log format has been approved.
The ODT file will always contain library information (headers, lithology, modifiers, structures, and symbols), view file contents (track layout information, depth and screen units, scale and pen information (optional)) and ini file settings (curve defaults, computed curves and table definitions).
GEONet Template Customization Service Create your own Template You can create an ODT from an ODF using a wizard, which allows users to include or omit further plot elements from an existing ODF.
This option allows you to see information within the ODT organized in a tree structure.
It will warn you if some components of the ODT are not functioning correctly or have settings that are deemed not best practice.
When creating a template you can consult the document information tree to see what warnings appear, that would otherwise be not obvious.
You can therefore attempt to rectify them.

===== FILE: c:\Users\HaochengLin\Documents\GitHub\GEO-bot-prototype\Data\html_files\introduction\Working_with_Files\ODF_Update_File_(OUF).htm =====

ODF Update File ( OUF ) ODF Update File ( OUF ) ODF Update File ( OUF )
The ODF Update File or OUF, enables you to send daily updates with a high level of security, very cost effectively.
The prime purposes are adding security when e-mailing files (the OUF files must be loaded sequentially) and reducing the size, and therefore cost, of e-mailing daily updates over expensive satellite links.
The OUF file only carries ‘Update’ information; as a result the size of the files is reduced substantially.
While an ODF is being created at the wellsite, the size and complexity of the file increases throughout the duration of the well, as progressively more data is added to it.
The security of mailing the file becomes increasingly important, as do the actual costs involved.
In the scenario where a wellsite user e-mails files to an operations base, the sending of the entire ODF on a daily basis can become inefficient.
This is especially true when the recipient of the ODF is only concerned with the updates.
In the OUF model, the Wellsite user creates and maintains a Parent ODF.
From this is saved sequential OUF files.
These files are then mailed to the operations base and loaded to build an identical Child ODF.
The OUF files must be loaded in the correct sequence to successfully build the Child ODF.
The scenario below attempts to show the best practice on how this OUF model may be conducted.
At the Wellsite The first time the ODF is saved, you simply select Save
As from the GEO menu and supply a file name as normal.
When the first transfer of data from the wellsite to operations base is required, you would simply select Save OUF Updates from the GEO menu (or Send OUF Update Via Mail if you are going to send the file directly through an e-mail facility already present and set up in your PC – requires internet connection).
GEO takes the file name supplied and creates the first OUF file.
You would then e-mail, disk-fax or modem transfer the ‘WellX- 001.
ouf ’ to the operations base, instead of the WellX. odf.
Because of its in-built compressibility, the resultant OUF file will always be smaller than the Parent ODF, although for the very first transmission, there probably will not be such a marked difference in file sizes as is noticeable with the subsequent OUF s. Between transfers, the wellsite user can of course keep the Parent ODF up-to-date and saved on the local drive by using the normal Save procedure from the GEO menu.
For the next transfer, you would again select Save OUF Updates or Send OUF Update Via Mail.
GEO will then save this update as an OUF, called WellX-002.
ouf will simultaneously save the WellX. odf to the same point.
If you select Save As instead of Save OUF Updates it would result in a GEO warning message (840) advising you that saving the ODF to another name would break the connection between this ODF and all subsequent OUF s’.
Hence, say if the ODF was saved under a different name e. g. WellZ. odf.
The next time you go to Save OUF Updates the OUF would revert to WellZ- 001.
ouf because of the name change.
All the information loaded would then be encapsulated in this new OUF under the newly named ODF.
At the Operations Base You have two options for loading the OUF file.
Double-clicking on the OUF e-mail attachment.
This would launch GEO and load the OUF file automatically.
Detaching the e-mail attachment and selecting Load OUF Updates from the GEO menu After loading the 001.
ouf, the file must be saved as an ODF.
You can give a file name as appropriate.
The ODF created is often called the ‘Child’ ODF.
Each time an OUF is received and loaded, the ODF is saved prior to loading subsequent OUF s.
This ensures the child ODF is at the correct stage to load the next OUF in sequence.
The OUF s must be loaded in sequence.
If the wellsite user accidentally sends 004.
ouf without previously sending 003.
ouf the operations base user cannot load the file.
This is an important security element of the OUF file.
Please note, that OUF files may be opened and viewed within the full viewer application, GEO View.
OUF files cannot be opened directly using the free viewer, GEO e-View.
Files must first be consolidated within an ODF file (using GEO or GEO View).
After the ODF has been e-View enabled (using GEO ), it may only then be freely shared with users of the GEO e-View application.
What happens if the OUF connection is broken?
Any amendments made in the PARENT ODF, and the OUF subsequently created, will over-ride changes made in the Child ODF.
The Replication Information dialog box serves to advise the operations base user, if an amendment made in the Child ODF, has also been changed in the OUF they are loading.
This is the only scenario where a Replication Information dialog box is invoked detailing a Replication Conflict.
Example: The operations base user loads an OUF.
They then move a casing shoe symbol from 4000ft to 4500ft, and save the child ODF.
The next OUF received includes the same casing shoe having been moved in the PARENT ODF from 4000ft to 4250ft.
When the operations base user loads this OUF they will first see a Replication Information dialog box.
This advises the operations base user that a change made to the child ODF has also been changed in the parent ODF.
Exiting the dialog box will over-write the change made by the operations user in the child ODF.
After loading this OUF the casing shoe will be moved to 4250ft.
GEO takes the OUF to be loaded and checks the contents of this OUF against the contents of the child ODF.
In the above example, the Replication Information dialog box would not have been produced if the symbol had not been moved in the PARENT ODF.
The child ODF can be altered any number of times without invoking the ‘Replication Conflict’, as long as an alteration using the same log object has not been implemented in the parent ODF.
Further Example: A sandstone block has two pyritic modifiers at 3000ft. GEO assigns these modifiers their own unique id numbers (e. g. 20 & 21).
The child ODF is altered, by shifting modifier 20 to 2995ft and then saved.
The PARENT ODF is altered, by shifting modifier 21 to 3005ft.
The next sequential OUF is then saved.
When this OUF is loaded into the child ODF, a Replication Information dialog box will not open.
If however, in a later OUF, modifier 20 is shifted from 3000ft to 3005ft, upon loading this OUF a Replication Information dialog box is opened.
This is because the OUF records the shift from 3000ft to 3005ft in the parent ODF.
When scanning the child ODF, GEO by default, assumes the modifier to be positioned at 3000ft but upon loading the OUF scans and records the same modifier (20), positioned at 2995ft.
This ‘deviation’ invokes the Replication Information dialog box.

• Double-clicking on the OUF e-mail attachment. This would launch GEO and load the OUF file automatically.
• Detaching the e-mail attachment and selecting Load OUF Updates from the GEO menu

Output Database File ( ODF )
The Output Database File or ODF is the compact database file created by GEO.
It contains all information needed for rapid recall of all data relating to a particular well, either for further editing/update or for recreating the log.
The main components of an ODF are: Any loaded curve data and information about their source.
Layout related information, such as tracks, and the log scale Information about geological interpretation data, such as lithology, symbol and modifiers.
Information that you input, such as remarks, texts, tables and headers / trailers.
All libraries and fonts of the system in which the ODF was first created.
Embedded objects, such as documents, spreadsheets, maps, diagrams, photographs, etc. Links to related external documents, such as reports, spreadsheets, photographs, other ODF s, etc. ODF files may be shared with other members of the team (or with well partners) who require read-only access to the log and embedded curve data, using GEO View, or the free viewer, GEO e-View.
For added security, an ODF must first be made e-View enabled before it can be opened by GEO e-View.
The bottom status bar will state if the open ODF is e-View enabled or disabled.
If disabled, right click on it and select e-View enabled.
Both GEO View and GEO e-View can operate as ‘plug-in’ controls to the Internet Explorer web browser, so effectively allowing ODF files to be opened (normally by clicking a hyperlink to the ODF on an intranet web-page) within this standard browser.

Create a Qualitative Track Create a Qualitative Track
The qualitative track allows you to easily record and display a range of depth related values.
Examples include shows, porosity, grain-size and sorting.
Geo provides a visual indication of these values and builds the information into a database.
This means that at any point the data is easily accessible for export.
Histogram or Differential The histogram type might be used to present porosity.
If you click in a cell allocated ‘Good’ porosity, the cells to the left (Fair and Poor) would automatically be filled.
The differential type track does not automatically fill all cells to the left of the cell that is clicked.
For this reason, you can record from one cell through to the maximum number of available cells at any one depth.
The differential style might be used to present grain size where, if you click inside the ‘Coarse’ cell for instance, this does not mean that sample automatically has medium and fine characteristics.
To set up a Qualitative track: Create a qualitative track – see creating a presentation or track.
On the Edit menu, select Track Settings.
The Track Settings dialog box will open.

Should GEO or your system abnormally terminate (due to power failure or program crash), you will only lose data that changed since the last auto-save.
You will be presented with the option of re-loading your work from the back-up file on re-launching a session of GEO.
On normal termination of the application, the Back-up directory is flushed (deleted), ready for the next session.
If the value entered in this box is too small, it may cause inconvenience by frequent interruptions while the software creates a backup, especially when the file is large.
On the other hand, if the set time is too large, you may encounter a higher risk of losing more of your work, if the system terminates abnormally.
Do not use this AutoSave feature as the only means of backup for you file.
Always manually backup your ODF file to a different media or place or storage.
Setting of Wrap Curves - When a curve that is plotted on a track has a value, which falls outside the scale range assigned for that curve, you may wish to wrap the curve around (i. e. to present the back-up curves).

Global Settings for Depth Plots Global Settings for Depth Plots The Global Settings - which control the scale and log appearance attributes - can be accessed by selecting Global Settings on the Edit tab.
The Global Settings content will change depending on if your log is plotted against depth or time.
The following information is for logs plotted against Depth.
Depth Range and Zooms Tab The first tab in global settings is the Depth Range & Zooms tab.
Plot Depths from and to - Define the depth range of the log displayed on screen and also in print.
Setting these values to the bounds of the depth range you want to display or print does NOT of course remove from the ODF database, any stored data for the range outside of the bounds you have set.
The active view settings are merely altered (until reset) to limit the scrollable or printable section of log to that depth range specified.
If you specify the Plot Depths From as 0, when a data set starting from 1000 ft is loaded, the plot will start from 1000 ft, instead of 0 ft.
However, if the Plot Depths From is greater than 0 ft (but less than 1000 ft), the plot will start from this specified depth, when the same data set (also started from 1000 ft) is loaded.
Primary and Alternate Depth Display Attributes - You can display up to two depth systems on the plot; a Primary and Alternate depth system.
Orientation - Choose the orientation of both primary and alternate depth values from the drop list - it can be set to Left to Right, Top to Bottom or Bottom to Top.
Font - Specify the depth value font.
Primary and Alternate Depth System - Assign the depth system - MD, TVD, T WT or VSEC - of the Primary and Alternate Depth System.
TVD - If a TVD curve has been assigned to be used for TVD conversion, you can control how and when it displays.
TVD SS Correction - Enter a sub sea correction to display the TVD depth system as TVD SS.
Display TVD SS as Negative (-) - Check to display the TVD SS values with a minus sign before the depth value.
Use the TVD SS Correction - Check to display the TVD SS values on the plot.
This will replace the TVD value displayed on the plot.
Display TVD values every MD for Highly Deviated Sections - Check to display TVD / TVD SS values for every MD values available in highly deviated sections of the well.
Track Edge - Choose to display the track edge thickness as Normal, Medium or Wide.
The actual appearance of Normal, Medium and Wide widths are defined by the settings in Display Pen Widths in the Options dialog box on the Edit tab.
Center Line or Log Decade - Choose to display the track Centre Line (if displaying - controlled in the Track Settings dialog box) or Log Decade thickness as Normal or Medium.
Vertical Grid - Control the Color of the vertical grid lines.
Vertical Micro Grid (Log) Color - Choose the color of the mirco grid of logarithmic tracks.
Solid or Dashed Line radio buttons - Choose the micro grids to be solid or dashed.
Zooms Displa y X and Y - Set the Display (screen) zoom.
Print X and Y - Set the Print zoom.
The default value of 1 is 100% zoom.
To increase the zoom enter a value greater than 1.
To reduce the zoom, enter a value less than 1.
The X (width of the plot) and Y (length of the plot) zooms can be altered independently.
To maintain an aspect ratio, keep them the same.
If you increase the Print Zoom factor (for both X and Y) to 1. 5, to maintain the log scale as 1:500 at the hard copy, you need to change the plot vertical scale to 1 : (500 / 1. 5) or 1 : 333.
Horizontal Tracktext Font Scaling - When the plot scale changes, it can cause horizontal text entries (normally descriptions) to overlap and become cut off, preventing the whole text entry from being viewed.
To prevent this, use the following controls to resize the text when the scale changes.
Current Scale Factor - Displays the factor by which the horizontal track text has been reduced to compensate for the changed scale.
Compute whenever Plot Scale changes - Check to automatically change the text font size when the scale changes.
Vertical Track Text Font Scale - When the plot scale changes, it can cause vertical track text entries (normally the chrono and litho stratigraphy) to overlap.
To prevent this, enter the factor by which the vertical track text has to be reduced to compensate for the changed scale.
The second tab in global settings is the Scale & Grid tab.
S elect a Scale Settings - From the drop list, select a predefined scale or use the boxes below to define a new scale.

A default of -1 takes the horizontal segment from the vertical line to the edge of the track (left image) values greater than 0 will then determine the line length (right image - length define as 0. 5inches).
The third tab in global settings is the Other tab.
Here you can enter a descriptive text string that is specific to the ODF file.
Well ID - Enter Universal Well ID information.
Save Auto Recovery File - Enter a timing frequency for the autosave feature.
By default, this is set to 20 minutes.
At each set time interval, GEO will save a copy of your work-to-date to back-up file in the default or specified Back-up Directory.

• Display Cutoffs for Scale - If the scale of the plot is changed considerably, for example a 1:500 plot is converted to 1:10000, many small lithology units and vertical track text elements become compressed and the screen view and prints can appear unclear. To eradicate this, you can specify a minimum depth range display for Lithology and vertical Track Text elements for a selected compressed scale. Any lithology block or vertical track text, whose depth range is less than the cutoff range, will not be displayed at the selected plot scale. Cutoff Height for Lithology and Vertical Track Text - Enter the minimum depth range for lithology / vertical track text to be displayed. Display Modifiers - Check to display modifiers at the compressed scale. Cutoff Weight for Track Text , F ree Format , Symbols - Enter the cutoff weight for the track text, free format text and symbols. If any of these has a weight value less than the value defined, they will not be display when the plot scale is compressed.
• Cutoff Height for Lithology and Vertical Track Text - Enter the minimum depth range for lithology / vertical track text to be displayed.

• Cutoff Weight for Track Text , F ree Format , Symbols - Enter the cutoff weight for the track text, free format text and symbols. If any of these has a weight value less than the value defined, they will not be display when the plot scale is compressed.
• Depth Values - By default the depth values, which display in the depth track, display every 100ft or 100m. To change this, type the new value here. Note . The value must be a multiple of the Minor Grid interval.
• Minor, Major and Double Major Grid - On the plot, there are Minor , Major and Double Major horizontal grid lines. The depth interval at which these display can be customized, but their values must be multiples of each other and the Depth Values. Minor Grid -  Enter the minor grid interval here. Major Grid - Enter the major grid interval here. Double Major Grid - Enter the double major grid interval here.
• Minor Grid -  Enter the minor grid interval here.
• Major Grid - Enter the major grid interval here.

A default of -1 takes the horizontal segment from the vertical line to the edge of the track (left image) values greater than 0 will then determine the line length (right image - length define as 0.5inches).
• Plot Description - Here you can enter a descriptive text string that is specific to the ODF file.
• Universal Well ID - Enter Universal Well ID information.
• Save Auto Recovery File - Enter a timing frequency for the autosave feature. By default, this is set to 20 minutes. At each set time interval, GEO will save a copy of your work-to-date to back-up file in the default or specified Back-up Directory. Should GEO or your system abnormally terminate (due to power failure or program crash), you will only lose data that has changed since the last auto-save. You will be presented with the option of re-loading your work from the back-up file on re-launching a session of GEO. On normal termination of the application, the Back-up directory is flushed (deleted), ready for the next session. Note . If the value entered in this box is too small, it may cause inconvenience by frequent interruptions while the software creates a backup, especially when the file is large. On the other hand, if the set time is too large, you may encounter a higher risk of losing more of your work, if the system terminates abnormally. Warning . Do not use this AutoSave feature as the only means of backup for you file. Always manually backup your ODF file to a different media or place of storage.
• Setting of Wrap Curves - When a curve that is plotted on a track has a value, which falls outside the scale range assigned for that curve, you may wish to wrap the curve around (i.e. to present the back-up curves). Set the following attributes for wrapped curves. Maximum number of times to Wrap a Curve - Set the maximum number of times a curve may wrap around. Note . A curve can wrap a maximum of 50 times. Automatic Selection of Wrap Pen Type for Curves - Dictates whether or not GEO selects the corresponding ‘thick’ pen style, following the user’s selection of the normal pen type (in Display > Pens tab of the Curve Settings side bar). Should this checkbox be selected, when you select a dashed pen (No. 1) for the Normal Pen, GEO would automatically select the thick dashed pen (No. 11) for the Wrap Pen. Automatic Selection of Wrap Pens Color for Curves - Dictates whether or not GEO selects the matching color for the wrap pen, following the color selection for the normal pen. By default, both Automatic selection of Wrap Pen Type and Color for Curves check boxes are cleared or unchecked.

Create Template using Wizard Create Template using Wizard A template file (.
ODT file) can be generated from an ODF file using the template building wizard.
Creating a template from an approved final log ODF, preserves a standard format that can be used for future wells.
It will contain the library information (headers, lithology, modifiers, structures and symbols) and view file contents (track layout information, depth and screen units, scale and pen information (optional)).
The wizard allows users to include or omit further plot elements from an existing ODF.
Run a blank session of GEO and from the GEO menu select Template, then Create.
The Open dialog box will open.
Select the ODF you would like to generate a template from and click Open.
The wizard lists all the information stored in the ODF.

By default, all items within the ODF are automatically included when building an template.
However, you can choose which Item Details to exclude.
Use Exclude and Include to control the selected items presence in the template.
The wizard will then move on to the next Item Type.
If you plan to include every Item, on entering the wizard click Save As Template - all items will automatically be included and you will skip straight to saving the template.
From the Item Details field, rather than excluding or including all details, individual or multiple rows can be selected and included or excluded.
Each time Exclude is clicked, GEO assumes all remaining Item Details should be included for that Item Type (and vice versa).

Mouse Set Curve Data ↵ Mouse Set Curve Data Use this procedure to flat-line your data, creating a fixed gradient of curve values between two depth points.
This feature is useful in fining up/down sequences in Core Log analysis but can also be used to remove poor data.
On the Curve s tab, select Mouse Set Curve Data.
The cursor will change On the plot, place the cursor at the depth and value that you want the gradient to start.
Click and hold to start straightening the curve.
Move the cursor to the end depth and value and release.
The Set Curve Values dialog box will open.
The Curve number and Mnemonic will be listed.
Please check this is the curve you wish to straighten.
If there are multiple curves in the same track, you may have straightened the wrong curve.
If this is the case, select Cancel and read the Multiple curves on the s ame track information below.
Manually adjust the Depth required.
Three types of gradient can be defined.
For a vertical gradient: Tick Single Curve Value (Vertical) and enter the Curve Value.
For a fixed step gradient: tick Specify Curve Step (instead of curve end value) and enter the Curve Value and Curve Step Value.
GEO Message 1957 will appear if the curve step results in the modified curve appearing outside the curve range detailing the step value range available.
To define the start and end curve value, leave the tick boxes empty and enter both Curve Values.
Select OK to save the properties and generate the modified curve.
Multiple curves on the same track If there are multiple curves on the same track, there are three rules which determine which curve is used to draw the fixed gradient between two depths.
The last curve edited will be the default curve.
Therefore, if curve B is edited and then curve A (which appears beforehand in the list) is enabled, curve B will be used for Mouse Set Curve Values, until its display is turned off.

In a comma-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells are separated by a tab character.
In a comma-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells are separated by a tab character.
In those kinds of files, the range between commas or tabs is taken as the column width.
The application simply reads values between commas (or tabs) and ignores any spaces.
Compared to space-delimited data, these are more structured formats, and as such (together with the wholly structured LAS format, or compatible-XML format) are the preferred data formats to request from your vendors.

General Rules of Loading Data ↵ General Rules of Loading Data GEO can load several different types of ASCII files, such as CW LAS ( LAS ), tab-delimited, space-delimited and comma-delimited.
If the ASCII file is not a LAS file, there are some basic requirements to follow prior to loading.
The curve data must be laid out in rows and columns.
The first row of the file must contain the curve names or curve mnemonics (such as ROP, GR), and must not be blank.
The first column must always be depth.
Each curve mnemonic or unit must not contain any spaces and must not exceed thirty-two characters.
The last row of the file must be the last row of the data set.
The delimiter used at the first column must be same for rest for data.
Thus, you cannot have a data file that is delimited by comma and tab.
As an option, the second row of the file may be the curve unit (such as ft/hr, %, or GAPI ).
Deviation from the above may cause errors during loading data from files.
When such errors occur, it is advisable to examine the data set to determine the cause of the problem.
If possible, ask for LAS files from your data provider.
LAS format is the easiest curve data format to load.
If the vendor cannot provide LAS file, please ask them to give you the Tab-delimited ASCII file.

• The curve data must be laid out in rows and columns.
• The first row of the file must contain the curve names or curve mnemonics (such as ROP, GR), and must not be blank.
• The first column must always be depth.
• Each curve mnemonic or unit must not contain any spaces and must not exceed thirty-two characters.
• The last row of the file must be the last row of the data set.
• The delimiter used at the first column must be same for rest for data. Thus, you cannot have a data file that is delimited by comma and tab.
• As an option, the second row of the file may be the curve unit (such as ft/hr, %, or GAPI).

Loading XML Files (WellLogML) Loading XML Files (WellLogML) Loading XML Files (WellLogML)
The process of importing or loading an XML file is very similar to that of loading other types of data.
However, the information within the XML file is structured differently so viewing the files contents prior to importing is slightly different.
This specific structuring is called WellLogML.
WellLogML is similar to LAS, in that it specifies how well log data is organized in terms of Well Information, Curve Information, Parameter Information, etc.
For more information about XML as a file format, please review the section on Exporting Curve Data to XML Format, where we have links to relevant official websites on the subject.
On the GEO tab, select Import.
The Open dialog box will open.
Select the XML file and Open.
The WellLogML Information dialog box will open.
This contains 3 tabs; Global, Parameters and Curves.
Global General information contained within the XML file is detailed.
File name and path, related File ID and Data depth parameters are all included.
You may enter information on the authors or suppliers of the XML file in the field marked Vendor name.
The vendor name will appear in the Curve Data History.
Start and End Depths are filled in automatically as is the Sampling mode, Depth Increment, Unit s and the File Naming System.
The table window near the bottom of the dialog box contains the XML Tags and their corresponding XML value.
The XML Tag is taken from the original data set.
The information displayed here can be compared to the Well Information section of a LAS file.
The Tag is essentially the title of the data, for example
Well Name would be a common tag to appear here.
You then get the opportunity to supply a mnemonic to this tag.
The mnemonic used in the ODF can then be assigned to this tag and the XML value for that tag can therefore be applied to the specified mnemonic.
Parameters This table displays Parameter-Mnemonic information from the WellLogML file: the mnemonic, its Unit, Description and Value.
Curves Information on the curves that you wish to load are displayed here.
The Curve Mnemonic, Unit, Name and Description along with Null Value are listed for each curve within the XML file.
The last column, Load?, gives you the opportunity to deselect any curves that you do not wish to load.

• On the GEO tab, select Import . The Open dialog box will open.
• Select the XML file and Open . The WellLogML Information dialog box will open. This contains 3 tabs; Global, Parameters and Curves.
• Global General information contained within the XML file is detailed. File name and path, related File ID and Data depth parameters are all included. You may enter information on the authors or suppliers of the XML file in the field marked Vendor name . The vendor name will appear in the Curve Data History. Start and End Depths are filled in automatically as is the Sampling mode, Depth Increment , Units and the File Naming System . The table window near the bottom of the dialog box contains the XML Tags and their corresponding XML value. The XML Tag is taken from the original data set. The information displayed here can be compared to the Well Information section of a LAS file. The Tag is essentially the title of the data, for example Well Name would be a common tag to appear here. You then get the opportunity to supply a mnemonic to this tag. The mnemonic used in the ODF can then be assigned to this tag and the XML value for that tag can therefore be applied to the specified mnemonic.
• Parameters This table displays Parameter-Mnemonic information from the WellLogML file: the mnemonic, its Unit, Description and Value.
• Curves Information on the curves that you wish to load are displayed here. The Curve Mnemonic , Unit , Name and Description along with Null Value are listed for each curve within the XML file. The last column, Load ?, gives you the opportunity to deselect any curves that you do not wish to load. By default all curves within the XML file will be loaded. To deselect a curve, click the cell in the Load column for that curve (row) and type ‘N’. Type the letter ‘Y’ for yes if you decide to again load the curve.
• Select Apply to save any changes, then OK to load.

Load Space-delimited ASCII Files Load Space -delimited ASCII Files Load Space -delimited ASCII Files In a space-delimited ASCII data file, cells in a column are separated from the next, by one or more spaces.
As the number of the spaces may not be constant between columns, the width of each column needs to be explicitly specified.
It is very important to have the curve mnemonic, unit and data for each curve to lie within successive columns, and for the first row of data to be the curve mnemonic (column name).
In the Step 1 of the Data Import Wizard, adjust the column widths manually.
Ensure that the first row of the data file is fixed as the Curve Mnemonics (column names), by scrolling the data, as required, until the curve mnemonics are central within the text box field.

Create or Amend Table Templates ↵ Create or Amend Table Templates At some point, you may want to edit an existing table template with more columns, different column labels or even different default symbols.
You may want to create a completely new table template for ease of entering data specific to your odf.
See the software's limits on how many tables you can put in one ODF file.
The master resource for table templates is the GeoTable.
ini file which houses all the information needed to create a table.
GEO will use this set of templates for every new ODF made on a particular machine.
However, once an ODF or ODT is created the table templates are automatically saved in the document so that the template list is also saved if the file is to be shared and perhaps modified on another machine.
It is now far easier for template information to stay integral and thus safer.
Similarly, if a colleague sends you an ODF the templates would be inherent in the document, there would not be as before the possibility of the document reading your own master GeoTable.
Creating The table templates can be created or amended in the Registry Editor.
On the Edit tab, select Edit GEO Settings.
The Registry Editor will open.
Select the Table Template tab.
Select the template you wish to edit from Choose a Table Template.
Or to create a new template, select an <undefined> number.
Define or adjust the Table Template ID and Name if necessary.
If you intend the symbol to have a start and end depth, like a core symbol, tick REF1 and REF2.
Choose the Layouts that you want the symbols to display in by selecting from the Select Layouts where Symbols should Display.
Select a Category type that your table will belong to.
Type in the blank space to add a new category.
Choose the default symbol that is selected when you apply the table in Defaults for Symbol in Table Rows.
Enter the Track Number and the X Offset to define where the symbol will be placed, in relation to REF1.
Select No Symbol to disable all the symbol options.
Choose other symbols to be selectable in your table in the Select List of Symbols for this Table with associated Column.
You can also make the symbol choice depending on certain Column Text (see below section).
Define the table Columns and their related Parameter s. Field Name – Enter the title that will represent your column.
Data Type – Choose from many data types to restrict the information that is added to a cell.

System variables can be used here; enter the relevant code to enable (%%InxUnits"S or L).
Tooltip – Selecting Yes will make this columns data appear when you hover over the symbol with the mouse when displayed in the plot.
Value List – See Column/Symbol Text section below.
For computation in tables, the Data Type must be defined as Computed to assess this section.
All table columns defined as integer/decimal/date/time/date & time/start and end depths/start or end TWTs will be listed in the Parameter fields.
For operational diary and remarks tables please ensure that the Table Type is defined as Operational Diary or Operational Remarks as appropriate.
Column/Symbol Text It is possible to make the symbol selection dependent on the text entered in a particular column.
Setup your list of symbols and enter the text that will invoke the used of this symbol.
Define the column you wish the symbol choice to be based on and set as SymColTxt type.
The text you enter in this column in the actual table can be freehand, or preset in the Value List.
In the example above you see the Value List populated by related information.
Choosing the value V High would automatically choose the Hazard Very High symbol.
Build your Value list by entering the text, followed by a ‘|’ character.
If the old table template has been opened, you cannot apply the new edited template unless you delete the old format from the table.
If a table requires data to be uploaded/imported from a WitsML server you need to assign a relevant Object to the table by selecting from the drop down menu.
You also will need to define which element is to be used for the depth, again using the drop down menu.

===== FILE: c:\Users\HaochengLin\Documents\GitHub\GEO-bot-prototype\Data\html_files\processed_data\VOB_Files\Concept_of_Vector_Objects_(VOB).htm =====

Concept of Vector Objects ( VOB ) Concept of Vector Objects ( VOB ) Concept of Vector Objects ( VOB )
The following information is based around creating plot objects using the VLCP - Vector Language Compiler Program, a feature which comes as a standard with the GEO for Window application.
In conjunction with the VLCP package, GEO is packaged with a simpler drawing application called VectDraw, which allows you to create or modify log objects using a more user-friendly graphics interface.
Log objects such as symbols, modifiers, lithology patterns, headers, trailers and tables that appear on the plot, can all be customized by you.
But before we examine how we do that, it is important to understand some of the basic concepts.
Objects such as a Casing Shoe or a Core symbol are symbol definitions.
Similarly, a Lithology log header is a header definition.
Each definition has a unique filename and is organized in a directory structure with other allied definitions.
This directory is known as the Library, and is comprised of sub folders for Lithology, Structures, Symbols, Modifiers, and Headers.
In general, all header definitions will appear in the headers folder, the default file path for which is \ GEO for Windows\Library\Headers.
Likewise, all modifier definitions appear in the modifiers folder (default being \ GEO for Windows\Library\Modifiers).
The directory for those objects may be different from that above, depending on path specifications allocated or chosen during software installation.
All GEO software uses a custom format for defining such objects, which are referred to as Vector Objects.
They are stored on disk in two distinct forms: The text file that may be created or modified by the user.
The file has a. VOT extension, so it is usually called a VOT file.
The binary file created by compiling the corresponding VOT file, or alternatively by direct creation using the Vectdraw package.
This file has a. VOB extension and hence it is commonly called a VOB file.
When you first start a session of GEO, it polls the relevant directories and organizes the definitions ( VOB files) found in them in an appropriate fashion.
For instance, the symbol definitions appear as menu items under the Symbols menu.
Similarly, the lithology definitions appear in the Lithology Information dialog box.
Vector objects are made up of lines, shapes, texts, table-related text or mnemonics.
Symbols are created by using these elements and specifying their dimensions.
The dimension of a vector object may be specified to 1/10th of a millimeter.
As a result, the symbols can be very precise.
Vector objects have the distinct advantage over bitmapped objects in that they do not distort when sized.
Certain objects within GEO ( Symbols, Modifiers, Headers) may also be bitmaps.
Typically they are stored on disk in files with a. BMP extension.
The program only accepts two color bitmaps.
Typically, they are black and white.
Bitmaps may be created by any graphics application.
Depending on the complexity of the bitmaps, they may distort when scaled (aliasing).
Scaling factors, to cope with resolution differences between screen and printer need to be specified in the Zoom factor Bitmaps on Screen on the General tab of the Registry Editor dialog box.
Some high-end plotters cannot plot bitmaps.

Comma and Tab-delimited ASCII Files Comma and Tab-delimited ASCII Files Comma and Tab-delimited ASCII Files You can load data files or either comma-separated ( CSV ) or tab-delimited text type without additional manipulated via the Data Import Wizard.
In a comma-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells are separated by a tab character.
In a comma-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells are separated by a tab character.
In those kinds of files, the range between commas or tabs is taken as the column width.
The application simply reads values between commas (or tabs) and ignores any spaces.
Compared to space-delimited data, these are more structured formats, and as such (together with the wholly structured LAS format, or compatible-XML format) are the preferred data formats to request from your vendors.

Loading XML Files (WellLogML) Loading XML Files (WellLogML) Loading XML Files (WellLogML)
The process of importing or loading an XML file is very similar to that of loading other types of data.
However, the information within the XML file is structured differently so viewing the files contents prior to importing is slightly different.
This specific structuring is called WellLogML.
WellLogML is similar to LAS, in that it specifies how well log data is organized in terms of Well Information, Curve Information, Parameter Information, etc.
For more information about XML as a file format, please review the section on Exporting Curve Data to XML Format, where we have links to relevant official websites on the subject.
On the GEO tab, select Import.
The Open dialog box will open.
Select the XML file and Open.
The WellLogML Information dialog box will open.
This contains 3 tabs; Global, Parameters and Curves.
Global General information contained within the XML file is detailed.
File name and path, related File ID and Data depth parameters are all included.
You may enter information on the authors or suppliers of the XML file in the field marked Vendor name.
The vendor name will appear in the Curve Data History.
Start and End Depths are filled in automatically as is the Sampling mode, Depth Increment, Unit s and the File Naming System.
The table window near the bottom of the dialog box contains the XML Tags and their corresponding XML value.
The XML Tag is taken from the original data set.
The information displayed here can be compared to the Well Information section of a LAS file.
The Tag is essentially the title of the data, for example
Well Name would be a common tag to appear here.
You then get the opportunity to supply a mnemonic to this tag.
The mnemonic used in the ODF can then be assigned to this tag and the XML value for that tag can therefore be applied to the specified mnemonic.
Parameters This table displays Parameter-Mnemonic information from the WellLogML file: the mnemonic, its Unit, Description and Value.
Curves Information on the curves that you wish to load are displayed here.
The Curve Mnemonic, Unit, Name and Description along with Null Value are listed for each curve within the XML file.
The last column, Load?, gives you the opportunity to deselect any curves that you do not wish to load.
By default all curves within the XML file will be loaded.
To deselect a curve, click the cell in the Load column for that curve (row) and type ‘N’.
Type the letter ‘Y’ for yes if you decide to again load the curve.
Select Apply to save any changes, then OK to load.

Load Space-delimited ASCII Files Load Space -delimited ASCII Files Load Space -delimited ASCII Files In a space-delimited ASCII data file, cells in a column are separated from the next, by one or more spaces.
As the number of the spaces may not be constant between columns, the width of each column needs to be explicitly specified.
It is very important to have the curve mnemonic, unit and data for each curve to lie within successive columns, and for the first row of data to be the curve mnemonic (column name).
In the Step 1 of the Data Import Wizard, adjust the column widths manually.
Ensure that the first row of the data file is fixed as the Curve Mnemonics (column names), by scrolling the data, as required, until the curve mnemonics are central within the text box field.

Click anywhere in a data column to select its separator (vertical line), such that the separator color turns from black to red.
Click the Move selected Column edge plus and minus buttons to move the separator to the right and left respectively.
Moving a column separator causes all other separators to the right of it to move by the same amount.
Align the separator hard against the right edge of the data column, leaving no spaces.
Repeat steps 3 to 6 for each column that requires realignment of the separator.
Click OK to close the File View dialog box.
It is highly recommended that you scroll through the entire file to ensure the correct positioning of all column separators.
Ensure that the last entry in the file is the last row of data values, and not other spurious information.

Font s for Vector Objects Font s for Vector Objects Vector Object or VOB files may contain references to fixed text, mnemonics and tables.
Every text string that is displayed in the VOB file must have a font associated with it.
This association is defined in the VOB file in the form of a font number for each text string.
When the software displays or prints text from any VOB file, it uses the font that has been specified in the VOB file.
The way the defined VOB fonts will appear in the plot is specified in the Font s for Vector Objects.
To open this, on the Define tab, select Font s - VOB s.
If text in a header is created with font number 5, which is Arial 10 bold, it may look different on another PC that has Arial 6 regular as its font number 5.
You can use this dialog box to change the font type and size for this number 5 font, to get the same text fonts on both PCs.
When you receive an ODF file from another user, displaying the Font s for Vector Objects will give information on the fonts that the other person uses.
Therefore, this dialog box gives a fingerprint of how the VOB fonts were defined in the other session of the software, which has been used to create the ODF.
Font list Details all fonts currently defined for Vector Objects.
Each line briefly describes a single font.
Select a font from this box prior to changing its attributes such as its type, size and orientation.
The number on the left is the font number.
It is used to reference the font in VOB files.
The number is then followed by the font type (e. g. Arial).
The following number in parenthesis specifies the size of the font.
The size may appear in two different formats points or height.
When the format appears as height (e. g. 12 height), it is the default definition of the font and specifies the complete height of the font including internal leading.
If this font is selected from this dialog box and updated using Choose Font, the size is converted to a point size which does not include internal leading.
So a font with a height of 12 would appear as 9 points.
This size is then followed by the font style, such as regular, bold or italic.
Line Orientation Shows the orientation of a line of text in the currently selected font.
Selecting a different orientation affects all text that uses the currently selected font.

Header and Trailer Display Hierarchy ↵ Header and Trailer Display Hierarchy The header and trailer items can be rearranged to suit your requirements by establishing a hierarchy.
This is especially valuable when dealing with expanding data tables.
Care must be taken when organizing the order in which items are displayed as some may need to be placed side-by-side, thus fore only one can serve as the parent.
As you can see from the image above, the LITHOLOGY LEGEND is dependent on the LITHOLOG HEADER.
This means that any changes in the size or position of the header, will affect the LEGEND too.
It looks like this on the plot.

Mnemonics in GEO Mnemonics in GEO In a plot header or trailer, you need to be able to fill in well or log information such as well name, field name, company name, vendors name, name of the geologists, coring intervals, casing intervals etc.
To do this, a specific mnemonic is assigned to each piece of information in the plot header or trailer.
All mnemonics must be unique within the ODF file.
The software uses the mnemonic ID to uniquely identify a mnemonic.
A mnemonic consists of the following;
Component Example Mnemonic Identifier (ID) WD Description
Well Depth Value 115 Units FT View in Shell
No or Yes (Yes enables the mnemonic value to display when selecting the. odf file in windows explorer) Add mnemonic to header The following steps demonstrate how to add a Field Name mnemonic to the header.
If this mnemonic is added to the header of other layouts in the odf, then any changes made to the mnemonic Value will be changed in the other layout headers also.
Please note that mnemonics can only be added to headers if your license includes GEO Vectdraw.
Open the Header in GEO Vectdraw.
Use the Mnem Desc/Val/Unit tool to add a mnemonic.
The Mnemonic (Group ) Properties dialog box will open.
Enter the following information; Mnemonic - FN Mnemonic Description - Field Name Mnemonic Value - Drent Note.
Leave System Variable clear Save your changes in vectdraw.
Once the header has been finalized, you will see Field Name : Drent in each ODF header: Edit mnemonic Continuing the example above, the ' Field Name ' ( Mnemonic Description ) and ' Drent ' ( Mnemonic Value ) can be edited in GEO using one of these two methods; Edit directly in the ODF by left clicking the mnemonic description or value in the plot header or trailer.
From the Define Mnemonics dialog box - on the Define tab, select Mnemonics.
Here, you can also define pre-set values that can be selected from a drop list in the header.
GEO VectDraw is not be required for these alterations.
However, any changes made via these methods are only valid/happen in that particular ODF.
Add mnemonic values from Las File s : Information Block s When a LAS file is loaded to the GEO Software Suite, the software reads in and stores all the available mnemonics in the Parameter Information block and the Well Information block from that particular LAS file.
GEO then maintains these mnemonics on a per file basis.
The data in these blocks forms the basis for the final values for each mnemonic in a particular log.
If data is loaded in a non- Las format, but you wish to export it from GEO into Las format, then mnemonics will not automatically have their information block assigned.
However, this can be done manually in GEO.
On the Define tab, select Mnemonics.
The Define Mnemonics will open.
All data files loaded into the ODF will be available in the File drop down list at the top.
The corresponding mnemonics from those files will be listed in the box directly below in the mnemonics area.
To add a mnemonic to the plot, Multi-select by dragging the mouse over a range of entries in the mnemonics area, or hold Ctrl and click the individual mnemonics you wish to add.
They should now have a blue highlight Click Add to Plot.
The appropriate header will now populate with the information provided the mnemonics in the header VOB match.
Click Exit to return to the plot area.
In the Plot Mnemonics section to the right of the table you will see a column labeled Information Block.
Enter the letters P, W or O to stipulate which block you wish to assign the mnemonic to, Parameters, Well or Other.
Do this for each mnemonic you wish to appear in the required block and click Exit.
If you now wish to export a curve as XML, the mnemonics assigned as Parameter Information will now populate in the file.
Select the corresponding LAS file (from the File list box in Define Mnemonics dialog box) to determine the appropriate mnemonic values for your plot header.
The possible length of a mnemonic is 32 characters.
The API standards have not changed, so most mnemonics will still be three or four characters, but you have the option of creating user defined mnemonics that are longer.

The histogram type might be used to present porosity.
If you click in a cell allocated ‘Good’ porosity, the cells to the left (Fair and Poor) would automatically be filled.
The differential type track does not automatically fill all cells to the left of the cell that is clicked.
For this reason, you can record from one cell through to the maximum number of available cells at any one depth.

Presenting TVD Presenting TVD You can present the True Vertical Depth ( TVD ) in your log, just by itself, or together with the Measured Depth ( MD ).
In GEO, we call those two depth references as primary and alternate depth system.
Since we do not build any algorithm to convert the MD into TVD in the software, the user needs to have the MD versus TVD data loaded as a curve.
Such data can often be obtained from the vendor of survey data (nowadays, often the MWD company).
Then the software needs to be told which data is going to be used for MD - TVD calculation and determine which depth system is going to be displayed.
Inform the software which data is going to be used for MD - TVD calculation On the Depth tab in the Conversion group, select TVD from the Curve drop list.
Check the Use Data for TVD Conversion box.
If a subsea correction needs to be applied, check TVD SS Correction and enter the value in the TVD SS Correction text box.
To present it as a negative value, tick TVD SS as Negative.

The curve type is detailed in open and closed brackets following the curve name.
Normal Curve s that are loaded into GEO through Import from the GEO menu.
In curve lists, the file ID will follow the curve name.
User-defined Curve s that are created by the user in Curve Data on the Curve tab by entering the depth and corresponding data values.
Computed Curve that are generated within GEO, derived from loaded curves, constants, parameters, and expressions within the Computed Curve s section on the Curve s tab.
Spliced Curve s that are generated by the user, using the Splice feature on the Curve s tab.
They are created from a section of one or multiple curves.
Table Curve s that are generated from the table data.
Edited Non-user defined curves that have been edited in Curve Data on the Curve tab.
Computed Curve s are a standard feature only for GEO and GEO Lite.
Only user-defined curves allow the editing of depth values and creation of new depth values.
You can edit only the data values for all other curve types.
GEO always retains a copy of the original loaded or computed curve data, and you can choose to toggle display between edited and original curves.

Define New Curve Pens Define New Curve Pens Customize the way pens appear on the screen and on the printer using in Pen Definitions.
Up to twenty (20) customized pens can be defined (pen 0 through 19).
By default, pens 0 through 9 are predefined to represent normal thickness pens, and pens 10 through 19 are predefined to represent thicker pens.
When you save your plot-information in an ODF file, this definition of the pen is also stored in the same file.
Theory A pen definition consists of (up to) five segments of dot-combinations.
In each such segment, up to ten pixels can be turned on and up to another ten pixels can be turned off.
For example, a solid line could be defined either as: a single segment, 1 dot on, zero dots off a single segment, 2 dots on, zero dots off five segments, each with 10 dots on, zero dots off Note.
Pens consisting of longer definitions (all five segments defined, for example) draw more efficiently than those with shorter definitions (only one segment defined).
Since there is a large difference in the resolutions (pixels/dots per inch) between display-devices and printer-devices, the software has two different definitions for the same pen: one for the display-device and the other for the printer-device.
For example, the display-definition of a dash pen might consist of four pixels on, four pixels off, four pixels on, and so on while the printer-definition of the same dash pen might consist of ten pixels on, ten pixels off, ten pixels on, and so on.
The number difference is due to the generally higher resolution on the printer than the monitor (display).
Single pixel Two, three, four or five pixels side-by-side.
A square two, three, four or five pixels on each side.

Display Data Point Markers Display Data Point Markers Data points in a curve can be marked on the plot.
However, since these appear at actual data points, using such markers on a curve with a sample frequency of 0. 5 ft (6 inch) on a 1:500 scale would cause the markers to overlap each other.
Data point markers are therefore normally used on those data, which may not have a fixed sample frequency, such as shale density, or core porosity or permeability analyses.

For example, an ROP curve that has data range between 0 to 380 ft/min needs to be displayed with left and right edge scale at 0 to 300 ft/min.
To indicate a fast drilling region, a red curve shading needs to be applied between left track edge and any ROP curve whose value is greater than 300 ft/min. Ensure that the ROP curve has been wrapped right at least once, so the out-of-scale curve will be displayed on the track.

Splice Curves Splice Curves Take portions of different curves and splice them together to form a new curve.
The selected source curve is spliced onto the destination curve over the specified depth interval.
In general, the splicing operation is appropriate only for wireline curves.
This is because each wireline curve has its own first and last reading and curves need to be spliced to eliminate or minimize data falling outside these points.
The File ID of a spliced curve is [Spliced], indicating that the data is not original.
You are only able to splice curves into [Unused] or [Spliced] destinations so that the original data is left intact in case a spliced curve needs to be recreated with different splice points.
Mudlog data, on the other hand, should be appended rather than spliced as the data provided on a daily basis from the mudloggers constitute part of a continuous data-set.
However, sometimes, to satisfy the requirement of presenting ROP with different scales over different zones, the one ROP curve may be split up into the different zones using the splice function.
On the Curves tab, select Splice.
The Curve Splicing dialog box will open.
Select a curve from Source Curve.
The depth range of the curve will be displayed at the side.
In Select range to copy enter the start and end depth respectively.
The depth range entered must be the same or a subset of the source curve depth range.
Select a curve from Destination Curve on to which the source curve will be spliced.
Initially, the destination curve must be an [Unused] one.
The curve in Destination Curve will then bear the same mnemonic as the source curve and have a File ID of [Spliced].
Another Source Curve can be selected and a new data set can be spliced, by leaving the Destination Curve the same as what you have in step 5.
Click Splice to then splice two different curves from the Source Curve into one curve (as specified in the Destination Curve ).
If the source curve is being copied onto an existing curve, and there is an overlap between the source and destination curves, a dialog box will be presented.
Yes: overwrites the overlapping section of the destination curve with source curve values.
No: retains the destination curve values over the section of the overlap.
The above process may be repeated on the same destination curve with other source curves.

GEO Graph Introduction GEO Graph Introduction GEO Graph is an integrated application which allows you to create X-Y and Z plots from curve data or table data from within GEO.
This Graphs can then be displayed in the header or trailer.
Uses can range from well trajectory plots through to pressure plots.
Once the data is plotted, calculations of best-fit lines and line intersect can be achieved.
This accompanied by full integration with GEO serves as a useful graphics tool.
Benefits of using GEO Graph The focus throughout the GEO software Suite is to promote a minimal ‘time and effort’ logic.
The GEO / GEO Graph integration is no different as once you have created your Graph and placed it in a header or trailer it becomes completely dynamic.
Meaning if the data your graph is based on is changed or amended your GEO Graph document will automatically update.
This can be as a result of editing or importing Curve or Table data.
This also means if your GEO Graph document is set up in a blank ODT for example, when you load in applicable data, the GEO Graph document will automatically populate with the data.
You can invoke GEO Graph within a GEO document by double-clicking on the GEO Graph document displayed in the header or trailer area.
Learn how to a dd a graph (ggd file) to your ODF or ODT.
As part of the installation routine you will probably have installed a suite of example files and templates that have some example graphs already set up for you.
Please feel free to experiment with these files and see how GEO Graph could benefit your well log.

If the <Shift> key is depressed before the end point is defined, a vertical line will be drawn from the starting point to the depth where the end point is clicked.
If the <Ctrl> key is depressed before the end point is defined, a diagonal line will be drawn from the starting point to the end point.
Please note that this type of line can only be created with custom or solid lines.
To terminate the line definition mode, prior to defining the end point, press the <Esc> key.

• On the Home tab, select Line . The cursor will display the text ST.LINE to indicate that the mouse may be used to define the starting position of a line.
• Place the mouse at the point where the line should start and click. The cursor text will change to EN.Line .
• Place the mouse at the point where the line should end and click. The Line Definition dialog box will open.
• Select the line Type and Color .
• Re-position the line by entering the depth and X-position of the start and end line, in Start and End point attributes.
• You can also change the anchor for the start and end of line, by selecting from the Anchor box. Note . The X-position depends on the anchor point. You need to enter to which track the anchor is to be made, if you select either Left or Right edge of track in the Anchor section.
• To add an arrow to the line, select from the Arrow Styles .
• Click New to enter free format text that will be associated/related to the line. The Free Format Text Entry sidebar will open. Click to learn how to add free format text .
• Click OK to draw the line on the log.

Split Screen GEO Split Screen GEO To maximize the viewing potential of your logs it is possible to divide the main GEO window into two horizontal sections.
This allows you to view two totally separate areas of the plot.
This may be beneficial if you wish to compare two sections of your well log that are hundreds of feet/meters apart.
It is also possible to retain a header or trailer table data in one section whilst looking at the plot where that information refers.
To apply this feature: At the top of the main Vertical scroll bar on the right hand side of the window is a small gray bar, directly above the ‘up’ arrow.
Click and Hold with the left mouse button.
Drag down towards the middle of the screen.
The screen will now divide in two.
Two separate scroll bars will now appear, allowing you in each section to view any part of the log you wish.
To return the screen to just one whole section, simply click and hold the bar as before and drag it to the position above the top ‘up’ arrow.
You can also perform this same operation via the View tab, by selecting the Create / Close Split Window.
To split the screen so that the track legend automatically freezes on the top half of the screen, on the View tab click Freeze Legend Pane.

• At the top of the main Vertical scroll bar on the right hand side of the window is a small gray bar, directly above the ‘up’ arrow.
• Click and Hold with the left mouse button.
• Drag down towards the middle of the screen.
