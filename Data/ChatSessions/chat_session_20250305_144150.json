However, it is mentioned that there is a limit of 200 tracks at most.\n\nIt's recommended to use OIF files instead of sending unnecessary data by saving only the specific depth range of interest. To do this:\n\n1. Enter the From and To index range on the Depth tab (e.g., 7000-8000).\n2. Select \"Save Displayed Depth or Time interval As (OIF)\" from the GEO menu.\n3. Check the Statistics dialog box to ensure that no limits have been exceeded.\n\nNote: The exact track limit for an ODF is not specified in the provided documentation, and it's recommended to use OIF files for more efficient data management.",
